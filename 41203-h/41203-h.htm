<p>pon no other View
do I make a Dedication
of this Discourse to
your <i>Lordship</i>, then to
submit it to your acute
Judgment, expecting soon to hear
of your Approbation or Dislike of it.
If it so happen, that you highly
approve of it, I beg of you to be
sparing of your Commendations,
least I should be puff'd up with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>In my <i>Moderator</i>, some Expressions
dropt from my Pen about the
Miracles of our Saviour, which, for
want of Illustration then, gave your
<i>Lordship</i> some Offence, and brought
upon me more Trouble: But, having
now fully and clearly explain'd
my self out of the Fathers, I hope
you'll be reconciled to me; and as
you are a Lover of Truth, will, against
Interest and Prejudice, yield
to the Force of it.</p>

<p>Whether your Prosecution of me,
for the <i>Moderator</i>, was just and reasonable,
I'll not dispute here, having
already expostulated that Matter
with you in several Letters, to
which you would not condescend
to give me any Answer. For what
Reason you was silent, is best known
to your self. But, in my own Vindication,
I hope, I may publish
without Offence, that your taking
me for an <i>Infidel</i>, was such a Mistake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
as I thought no <i>Scholar</i> could
have made; and the Injury done to
my Reputation and low Fortunes,
by the Prosecution, so considerable,
that the least I expected from your
<i>Lordship</i>, was a courteous Excuse,
if not an ample Compensation, for
it.</p>

<p>As to the Expediency of prosecuting
<i>Infidels</i> for their Writings
(in whose Cause I am the farthest
of any Man from being engaged)
I will here say nothing. The Argument,
<i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, has already,
by one or other, been copiously
handled. And I don't know but I
might be, with your <i>Lordship</i>, on
the persecuting side of the Question;
but that it looks as if a Man was
distrustful of the Truth of Christianity,
and conscious of his own Inability
to defend it; or he would
leave that <i>good Cause</i> to God himself
and the Sword of the Spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
without calling upon the <i>Civil
Magistrate</i> for his Aid and Assistance.</p>

<p>That scurvy <i>Writer</i> of the <i>Scheme
of literal Prophecy</i>, &amp;c. which your
<i>Lordship</i> must have heard of, would
insinuate, that they are only atheistical
Priests, who, for fear of their
Interests in the Church, set Persecutions
on foot: But after your
<i>Lordship</i> has publish'd a strenuous
Defence of Christianity to the Purpose
of our present Controversy,
I'll have no such Suspicions of you.</p>

<p>Your <i>Lordship</i>'s persecuting (or,
if you will, prosecuting) Humour,
is reputedly all pure Zeal for God's
Glory; and, with all my Heart,
let it be so accounted, whether it
be according to Knowledge or not.
Against Popery and Infidelity you
are all Ardency! Who does not
commend you? Who can question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
the Sincerity of the Zeal of a Protestant
<i>Bishop</i>, and of a Protestant
<i>Clergy</i>, when they persecute the
Enemies of their Church, that considers
their own Steadiness to Principles
against Interest, under all
Changes, since the Reformation;
and their Abhorrence of Extortion
upon the People, for the Duties of
their Function, in and about this
City. Such Honesty and Constancy
in their Profession, is a Proof of the
Integrity of their Hearts, or I know
not where to find one.</p>

<p>But that your <i>Lordship</i>'s Zeal for
Religion is very remarkable and
successful, I could prove by many
Instances; one is, <i>that</i> of your routing
a turbulent Sect of <i>Peripateticks</i>
out of St. <i>Paul</i>'s Cathedral; and if
you could as effectually clear <i>Christ</i>'s
Church of <i>Infidels</i>, what a glorious
Bishop would you be!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>And what Pity is it, that <i>Infidels</i>
likewise are not to be quell'd with
your Threats and Terrors! which
(without the Weapons of sharp
Reasonings, and thumping Arguments,
that others are for the Use
of) would transmit your Fame to
Posterity, for a notable Champion
for Christianity, as certainly as,
that your judicious Prosecution of
the <i>Moderator</i> for Infidelity is here
remember'd by,</p>

</div>

<p>f ever there was an useful
Controversy started, or revived
in this Age of the
Church, it is <i>this</i> about
the <i>Messiahship</i> of the holy
Jesus, which the <i>Discourse
of the Grounds</i>, &amp;c. has of late rais'd.
I believe this Controversy will end in
the absolute Demonstration of Jesus's
<i>Messiahship</i> from Prophecy, which is
the only way to prove him to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<i>Messiah</i>, that great Prophet expected by
the <i>Jews</i>, and promised under the Old
Testament. And tho' this way of Proof
from Prophecy seems to labour under many
Difficulties at present; and tho' some <i>Writers</i>
against the <i>Grounds</i>, being distressed
with those Difficulties, are for seeking Refuge
in the Miracles of our Saviour; yet
we must persist in it, till what I have no
doubt of, his <i>Messiahship</i> shall be clearly
made out by it.</p>

<p>And the way in Prophesy that I would
take for the Proof of <i>Jesus</i>'s <i>Messiahship</i>,
should be by an allegorical Interpretation,
and Application of the Law and the Prophets
to him; the very same way, that all
the Fathers of the Church have gone in;
and the very same way, in which all the
ancient <i>Jews</i> say their <i>Messiah</i> was to fulfil
the Law and the Prophets: But this
way does not please our ecclesiastical <i>Writers</i>
in this Controversy, neither will they
at present give any Ear to it.</p>

<p>The Way in Prophecy that they are for
taking, is by a literal Interpretation and
Application of some Prophecies of the Old
Testament to our <i>Jesus</i>, but they are hitherto
unsuccessful in this Way. The Authors
of the <i>Grounds</i> and of the <i>Scheme</i>,
grievously perplex them with their Objections
against this way of Proof, so far as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
being sensible, I say, of almost insuperable
Difficulties in it, they are flying apace to
the Miracles of our Saviour, as to their
sole and grand Refuge.</p>

<p>But to show that there's no Sanctuary
for them in the Miracles of our Saviour, I
write this Discourse: And this I do, not
for the Service of Infidelity, which has no
Place in my Heart, but for the Honour of
the Holy <i>Jesus</i>, and to reduce the <i>Clergy</i>
to the good old way of interpreting Prophecies,
which the Church has unhappily
apostatis'd from, and which, upon the Testimony
of the Fathers, will, one Day, be
the Conversion of <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>

<p>For this Opinion, that there is no Sanctuary
in the Miracles of our Saviour, I
chanc'd to say in the <i>Moderator</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <i>That
Jesus's Miracles, as they are now-a-days
understood, make nothing for his Authority
and Messiahship</i>. And again,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> <i>That I
believe, upon good Authority, some of the
Miracles of Jesus, as recorded by the
Evangelists, were never wrought, but are
only related as prophetical and parabolical
Narratives of what will be mysteriously
and more wonderfully done by him</i>:
Which Expressions gave Offence to some
of our <i>Clergy</i>, and brought upon me their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Indignation and Displeasure. I see no Reason
to depart from the said Expressions, or
so much as to palliate and soften them,
much less to retract them; but in Maintenance
of my Opinion, to the Honour of our
<i>Messiah</i>, and the Defence of Christianity,
I write this Treatise on Jesus's Miracles,
and take this Method following.</p>

<p>I. I will show, that the Miracles of healing
all manner of bodily Diseases, which
<i>Jesus</i> was justly famed for, are none of the
proper Miracles of the <i>Messiah</i>, neither
are they so much as a good Proof of his
Divine Authority to found a Religion.</p>

<p>II. That the literal History of many of
the Miracles of Jesus, as recorded by the
Evangelists, does imply Absurdities, Improbabilities,
and Incredibilities, consequently
they, either in whole or in part,
were never wrought, as they are commonly
believed now-a-days, but are only
related as prophetical and parabolical Narratives
of what would be mysteriously and
more wonderfully done by him.</p>

<p>III. I shall consider what Jesus means,
when he appeals to his Miracles as to a
Testimony and Witness of his Divine Authority,
and show, that he could not properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
and ultimately refer to those he then
wrought in the <i>Flesh</i>, but to those mystical
ones, which he would do in the <i>Spirit</i>;
of which those wrought in the Flesh are
but mere Types and Shadows.</p>

<p>In treating on these Heads, I shall not
confine my self only to Reason, but also
to the express Authority of the Fathers,
those holy, venerable, and learned Preachers
of the Gospel in the first Ages of the
Church, who took our Religion from the
Hands of the Apostles, and of apostolical
Men, who dy'd, some of them, and suffer'd
for the Doctrine they taught; who professedly
and confessedly were endu'd with
divine and extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit;
who consequently can't be supposed
to be Corrupters of Christianity, or Teachers
of false Notions about the Miracles of
our Saviour, or so much as mistaken about
the apostolical and evangelical Sense and
Nature of them. I know not how it comes
to pass, but I am a profound Admirer, and
an almost implicit Believer of the Authority
of the Fathers, whom I look upon
as vast Philosophers, very great Scholars,
and most orthodox Divines. Whatever
they concurrently assert, I firmly believe.
And tho' they are, for the most part, mysterious
Writers out of the Reach of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Capacities of many, who slight them; yet
I, who have had the Honour and Happiness
of much of their Acquaintance, fancy
my self well apprised of their Meanings.
If at any time I read a Passage in them
which I don't presently apprehend, I salute
it with Veneration for all that, till
my Understanding is opened to receive the
Sense of it. If I meet with but a single
Opinion in any one of them, I pay my
Respects to it; but where there is an Harmony
and Agreement of Opinion amongst
them, it is with me, and ought to be with
all Christians, of such Weight, as to bear
down all Prejudice, Opposition, and Contradiction
before it; or the Authority of
no Man, whether ancient or modern, is to
have any Regard paid to it; and of what
ill Consequence to Religion such an utter
Rejection of Authority will be, I need not
say.</p>

<p>This I thought fit to premise, concerning
the Authority of the Fathers, to abate
of the Prejudice beforehand, which some
may conceive against the following Discourse
about the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>. I don't
question, but some may be startled at the
foregoing Heads, as if, what is the farthest
of any thing from my Heart, the Service
of Infidelity was in View; but craving the
Temper and Patience of such Readers for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
a while, and they shall find, that its no
other than just Reasoning, clear Truth,
and primitive Doctrine about <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles,
that I advance: Or if it should so
happen, that none besides my self should
discern the Reasoning and Truth of the Argument;
yet I hope it will not be thought
a Crime to revive primitive Doctrine,
which none will be able to deny it to be,
whether they like it or not. If I err, I err
upon Choice with the Fathers, of whose
Faith I am. And if any are offended at
what follows about the Miracles of <i>Christ</i>,
let them turn their Displeasure and Indignation
against the Fathers, for whose express
or implicit Opinions I can be deserving
of no Blame.</p>

<p>I am sorry for the Occasion of such a
Preface against Offence, which the Apostacy
of the Age, and its Unacquaintedness
with the Fathers, has made necessary. So
I enter upon the particular handling of the
Heads foregoing. And,</p>

<p>I. I will show that the Miracles of healing
all manner of bodily Diseases, which
<i>Jesus</i> was justly famed for, are none of the
proper Miracles of the Messiah, nor are
they so much as a good Proof of <i>Jesus</i>'s
divine Authority to found and introduce a
Religion into the World.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>And to do this, let us consider, first, in
general, what was the Opinion of the Fathers
about the Writings of the <i>Evangelists</i>
in which the Life of <i>Christ</i> is recorded.
<i>Eucherius</i> says,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <i>That the Scriptures
of the New as well as Old Testament, are
to be interpreted in an allegorical Sense</i>.
And this his Opinion, is no other than the
common one of the first Ages of the Church,
as might be proved by many the like Expressions
of other Fathers. As in such Expressions,
they do not except the Writings
of the <i>Evangelists</i>; so they must include
the History of <i>Christ</i>'s Miracles, which as
well as other Parts of the History of his
Life, is to be allegoriz'd for the sake
of its true Meaning; consequently the
literal Story of Christ's Miracles proves
nothing.</p>

<p>But let's hear particularly their Opinion
of the Actions and Miracles of our Saviour.
<i>Origen</i> says, that<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> <i>Whatsoever Jesus
did in the Flesh, was but typical and
symbolical of what he would do in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Spirit</i>; and to our Purpose,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that <i>the
several bodily Diseases which he healed,
were no other than Figures of the spiritual
Infirmities of the Soul, that are to
be cured by him</i>. St. <i>Hilary</i> is of the same
Mind with <i>Origen</i>, as any one may see by
the<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Expressions referr'd to, and his
Commentary on St. <i>Matthew</i>. St. <i>Augustin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and St. <i>John</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of <i>Jerusalem</i>,
both say, that the Works of <i>Jesus</i> import
farther Mysteries; and with them, the rest
of the Fathers agree, making the Miracles
that <i>Jesus</i> did then, no more than the
Shadow of some more powerful and mystical
Operations to be done by him, as I
could show by more Citations out of them,
if it was needful. But from the foregoing
Citations out of the Fathers it is plain, in
their Opinion, that our modern <i>Divines</i>
are in the wrong of it, to lay much Stress
on any of the Operations of <i>Jesus</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
he did in the Flesh, for the Proof of his
divine Authority and <i>Messiahship</i>, which
is only to be proved by his more mysterious
Works, of which those done in the
Flesh are but Type and Figure.</p>

<p>But to come closer to the Purpose, let's
see how indifferently, I had almost said
contemptibly, the Fathers speak of the Miracles
of <i>Jesus</i>, and particularly of his
Power of healing all bodily Diseases, which
by modern <i>Writers</i> is so much magnified
and extoll'd. St. <i>Iren&aelig;us</i> says,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> that if
<i>we consider only the then temporal Use of
Jesus's Power of Healing, he did nothing
grand and wonderful</i>; consequently <i>Iren&aelig;us</i>
could not hold, that <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles
then wrought, were a sufficient Proof of
his divine Authority, much less of his <i>Messiahship</i>.
<i>Origen</i> says<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that <i>tho' many
were brought to believe in Jesus upon the
Fame of the Miracles which he did once
among the</i> Jews, <i>yet</i> (what implies the Insufficiency
of them for the Conversion of
Men) <i>he intimates that his greater and
mystical Works do prove his Authority</i>.
St. <i>John</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i> says<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that <i>Jesus's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Cures performed upon the Blind</i>, &amp;c.
<i>were indeed considerable and great, but
unless he do daily as mighty Works in his
Church, we ought to forbear our Admiration
of him.</i> St. <i>Augustin</i> not only says<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
that <i>if we examine into Jesus's Miracles
by human Reason, we shall find he
did nothing great, considering his Almighty
Power, and considering his Goodness,
what he did was but little</i>; but he
tells us also, that<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> <i>such Works as Jesus
did, might be imputed to, and effected
by Magic Art</i>. And accordingly <i>Moses</i>
and our Saviour himself confess, that false
Prophets, and false Christ's, will do Miracles;
and <i>Anti-Christ</i> himself, according
to St. <i>Paul</i>, will do them to the Deception
of Mankind. Nay, the Fathers<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
say, what I believe, that <i>Anti-Christ</i> will
imitate and equal <i>Jesus</i> in all his Miracles
which he wrought of old. How then can
we distinguish the true Prophet from the
false; the true <i>Christ</i> from the <i>Anti-Christ</i>
by Miracles? our <i>Divines</i> will find it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
hard to do it, if what the Fathers say of
<i>Anti-christ</i> be found true. Moreover History
affords us Instances of Men, such as
of <i>Apollonius Tyan&aelig;us</i>, <i>Vespasian</i>, and of
the <i>Irish Stroaker</i>, <i>Greatrex</i>, who have
miraculously cured Diseases to the Admiration
of Mankind, as well as our <i>Jesus</i>:
But if any of them, or any other greater
Worker of Miracles than they were, should
withall assume to himself the Title of a
Prophet, and Author of a new Religion,
I humbly conceive, we ought not to give
heed to him.</p>

<p>Neither is there the least Reason that
we should; for the Power of doing Miracles
is no certain, nor rational Seal of the
Commission and Authority of a divine Lawgiver.
St. <i>Paul</i> says<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> there is a <i>Diversity
of the Gifts of the Spirit, for to
one is given by the Spirit, the Word of
Wisdom; to another the Word of Knowledge;
to another the Gift of Healing;
to another the working of Miracles; to
another Prophecy; to another discerning
of Spirits; to another divers Kinds of
Tongues; to another the Interpretation of
Tongues.</i> These Gifts may be given apart
and separately. One of them may be
conferr'd on this Man, and another of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
on his Neighbour. There is no Necessity
that any two or more of these Gifts should
meet in one Man. To argue then, that a
Man, who has one of these Gifts, must have
the other; that is, that he must needs have
the Gift of Wisdom, or of Prophecy, or
of discerning of Spirits, or of divers Kinds
of Tongues, because he has the Gift of
Healing and of working Miracles, is very
inconclusive, and false Reasoning: And yet
this is the Reasoning of our modern Writers
who would prove <i>Jesus</i>'s Authority,
to found a Religion, from his Miracles. I
don't question but <i>Jesus</i> had all the foresaid
Gifts and Powers of the Spirit in a
most superlative Degree; but then it is
unreasonably inferr'd, for all that, that a
Man, because he of Certainty has some of
them, must of consequence have the other.
St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> cautions us against being
deceived into a good Opinion of a Man's
Wisdom, because of his Power to do Miracles.
And I think accordingly, that we
may as well say, that the strongest Man is
the wisest; or that a good Physician must
needs be a good Casuist; or that the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Mathematician is the ablest Statesman, as
that <i>Jesus</i>, because he was a Worker of
Miracles, such as his are, and a Healer of
all manner of Diseases, ought to be received
as the Guide of our Consciencies, the
Director of our Understandings, the Ruler
of our Hearts, and the Author of a Religion.</p>

<p>What then will the Writers against
the <i>Grounds</i> do to prove <i>Jesus</i>'s Authority
and <i>Messiahship</i> from his Miracles?
Or how by his Miracles will they be able
to distinguish him from an Impostor, a false
Prophet, and the <i>Anti-christ</i>? Why, they
will say perhaps,</p>

<p>1. That besides Greatness of Power, there
was nothing but Goodness, Kindness, and
Love to Mankind shewn in <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles.
As to the Miracles of false Prophets
and Impostors, if they be, many of them,
of a kind and benevolent Aspect, yet the
<i>Devil</i>'s Foot, if we look well to it, will
discover it self in some ludicrous and mischievous
Pranks: But <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles were
all of a beneficent Nature; He went about
doing good, healing all manner of Diseases
among the People, and did no Wrong to
any one; which is a good Argument, they
say, of his divine Authority, or God would
not have suffer'd, nor the <i>Devil</i> have
work'd such a Testimony in behalf of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
On this Head our <i>Divines</i> are copious and
rhetorical, and many notable and florid
Harangues have they made on it. But</p>

<p>In answer to them, they don't seem to
have their Memories at Hand, when they
declaim at this rate. The Fathers, upon
whose Authority I write, will tell such
Orators, that <i>Jesus</i>, if his Miracles are to
be understood in the literal Sense, did not
only as foolish Things as any Impostor
could do, but very injurious ones to Mankind.
I shall not here instance in the
seemingly foolish and injurious Things
which <i>Jesus</i> did for Miracles, intending
under the next Head to speak to some of
them: But they are such, if literally true,
as our <i>Divines</i> do believe, as are enough
to turn our Stomachs against such a Prophet;
and enough to make us take him for
a <i>Conjuror</i>, a <i>Sorcerer</i>, and a <i>Wizard</i>, rather
than the <i>Messiah</i> and Prophet of the
most High God. But</p>

<p>2. To prove the <i>Messiahship</i> of the Holy
<i>Jesus</i> from his Miracles, our <i>Divines</i> urge
the Prophecies of the Old Testament, such
as that of <i>Isaiah</i>, <i>C.</i> xxxv. <i>V.</i> 5, 6. <i>Then
the Eyes of the Blind shall be opened, and
the Ears of the Deaf shall be unstopp'd;
then shall the lame Man leap as the Hart,
and the Tongue of the Dumb sing</i>; and say
that these Prophecies were accurately fulfill'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
by our <i>Jesus</i> in the several specifical
Cures of Blindness, Deafness, Lameness,
and Dumbness, which he often perform'd
upon one or other; and, inasmuch as our
Saviour seems to appeal to such Prophecies,
do conclude this his Accomplishment of
them, to be no less than a Demonstration,
that he was the true <i>Messiah</i>, that great
Prophet, who was to come into the World.
To which I answer,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, That the Accomplishment of Prophecies
that can neither be given forth by
human Foresight, nor fulfill'd in a Counterfeit,
are good Proofs of <i>Jesus</i>'s <i>Messiahship</i>:
But then, what shall we say if others
besides <i>Jesus</i> should do the like Cures and
Miracles? It is said of <i>Anti-christ</i>, and I
believe it, that he will not only do all the
Miracles that <i>Jesus</i> did, but will appeal
to the like Prophecies too. How then we
are to distinguish the <i>true</i> Christ from the
<i>false</i> Christ by Miracles and Prophecies in
this Case, is the Question, which I leave
with our <i>Divines</i> to consider of an Answer
to, against the Time that it is proved
that <i>Anti-christ</i> does all those Miracles,
which <i>Jesus</i> in the Flesh wrought. But</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, The foresaid Prophecies and
others mentioned in <i>Isaiah</i>, neither were,
nor could be Prophecies of the miraculous
Cures of bodily Diseases which <i>Jesus then</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
did. And this may be made appear, not
only from the Context of those Prophecies
which received then no Accomplishment
from <i>Jesus</i>, who ought to have fulfill'd
one Part of the Prophecy as well as
the other, or is not to be taken for the
Fulfiller of either; but from the Opinion of
both <i>Jews</i> and <i>Fathers</i>, who adjourn the
Accomplishment of those Prophecies to
Christ's spiritual Advent. But</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, The Prophet <i>Isaiah</i>, in the
Place above cited, speaks not of bodily
Blindness, <i>&amp;c.</i> which the <i>Messiah</i> is to
heal, but of the spiritual Distempers of the
Soul, metaphorically so called; as may be
easily proved, not only from the Prophecies
themselves, but from the old <i>Jews</i>,
who were allegorical Interpreters of those
Distempers, and from the antient Fathers,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
who so understood them. Consequently
our <i>Jesus</i>'s healing of those bodily
Diseases, was no proper Accomplishment
of those Prophecies. It is true our
Saviour, <i>Matt.</i> xi. 4, 5. seems to appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to those Prophecies, and to make his Cure
of corporal Distempers an Accomplishment
of them: But he means not in the literal
Sense, that our <i>Divines</i> take him in, as I
shall show hereafter, when I come to consider
what <i>Jesus</i> means, by appealing to
his Works and Miracles, as bearing Witness
of him.</p>

<p>Our <i>Divines</i> then may admire and adore
<i>Jesus</i> as much as they please for his Miracles
of healing bodily Distempers; but I am
for the spiritual <i>Messiah</i> that cures those
Distempers of the Soul, that metaphorically
pass under the Names of Blindness, Lameness,
Deafness, <i>&amp;c.</i> And the Cure of these
spiritual Diseases, is the proper and miraculous
Work of the true <i>Messiah</i>; for the sake
of which, says<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> St. <i>Augustin</i>, <i>Jesus</i>
condescended to do those <i>little</i> Miracles
of healing bodily Distempers, which were
but the Type and Shadow of his more stupendous
Miracles of curing spiritual Diseases.
The Cure of spiritual Infirmities
is a God-like<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Work, above the Imitation
of Man or of <i>Anti-christ</i>, infinitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
more miraculous than the healing any bodily
Distempers can be.</p>

<p>Whether our <i>Jesus</i> be at this Day such
a spiritual <i>Messiah</i>, I leave to our <i>Divines</i>
to consider, with those spiritual Distempers
of the Church, that seem to want his miraculous
Hand and Touch. The Fathers
of the Church said, that <i>Jesus</i> was <i>in part</i>
such a spiritual <i>Messiah</i> in their time,
and argued<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> his <i>Messiahship</i>, not from
bodily Cures, but from his most miraculous
Cures of the Diseases of the Soul:
But there was another and future Time, in
which he would be such a spiritual and
glorious <i>Messiah</i> to the greatest Perfection.
In the mean while, no healing of corporal
Distempers can prove <i>Jesus</i> to be the <i>Messiah</i>,
nor any other of his miraculous Works
recorded in the <i>Evangelists</i>: So far from
it, that</p>

<p>II. I shall prove that the literal Story of
many of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, as they are recorded
in the <i>Evangelists</i>, and commonly
believed by Christians, does imply Improbabilities
and Incredibilities, and the grossest
Absurdities, very dishonourable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Name of Christ; consequently, they, in
whole, or in part, were never wrought,
but are only related as prophetical and parabolical
Narratives of what would be mysteriously
and more wonderfully done by
him.</p>

<p>The reading of this Head will, I doubt
not, strike with Horror some of our squeamish
<i>Divines</i>, who, notwithstanding they
will sacrifice almost any Principles to their
Interest, will not bear that our literal evangelical
History of such renown'd Miracles
should be thus called in Question, and contemptuously
spoken of. What does this
<i>Author</i> mean, will some say, thus to do
Service to Atheism and Infidelity? Away
with him! Our Indignation is moved against
him! No Censure and Punishment can be
too severe for such Impiety, Profaneness,
and Blasphemy, as is aim'd at, and imply'd
in this Proposition.</p>

<p>To calm therefore the Spirits, and abate
the Prejudices of such Accusers, I must
proceed with the greater Caution and with
Reason and Authority well fortify myself
before and behind, or I shall feel the Weight
of the Displeasure of our <i>Divines</i>, who are
prepossess'd of the Belief of the literal Story
of all <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles.</p>

<p>Before then I enter upon the particular
Examination of any of his Miracles, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
premise two or three general Assertions of
the Fathers about them. And first <i>Origen</i><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
says, that in the historical Part of the
Scriptures, <i>There are some Things inserted
as History, which were never transacted,
and which it was impossible should be
transacted; and other Things, again, that
might possibly be done, but were not</i>. This
he asserts of the Writings of the <i>Evangelists</i>,
as well as of the Old Testament, and
gives many Instances to this Purpose. St.
<i>Hilary</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> says, <i>There are many historical
Passages of the New Testament, that
if they are taken literally, are contrary to
Sense and Reason, and therefore there is
a Necessity of a mystical Interpretation</i>.
And St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> says, that <i>there are
hidden Mysteries in the Works and Miracles
of our Saviour, which if we incautiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and literally interpret, we shall run
into Errors, and make grievous Blunders.</i>
Of the same Mind are the rest of the Fathers,
as might be proved by express or
implicit Citations; but, studying Brevity,
I think the three Testimonies above, enough
to cool the Rage, and assuage the Prejudices
of my Adversaries against the Proposition
before us, which I now come to a
particular Consideration of; that is, to shew
that the Story of many of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles
is literally absurd, improbable, and incredible.
And</p>

<p>1. To speak to that Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>'s
<i>driving the Buyers and Sellers out of the
Temple</i>, which all the<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> four Evangelists
make mention of.</p>

<p>I have read in some modern Author
whose Name does not occur to my Memory,
that this was, in his Opinion, the most
stupendous Miracle that <i>Jesus</i> wrought.
And, in truth, it was a most astonishing
one, if literally true, and <i>Jesus</i> must appear
more than a Man, he must put on an
awful and most majestick Countenance to
effect it. It is hard to conceive, how any
one in the Form of a Man, and of a despised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
one too, (and we don't read that
<i>Jesus</i> chang'd his human Shape) with a
Whip in his Hand, could execute such a
Work upon a great Multitude of People,
who were none of his Disciples, nor had
any regard for him. Supposing he could,
by his divine Power, infuse a <i>panick</i>
Fear into the People; yet what was the
Reason that he was so <i>eaten up</i> with
Zeal against the Profanation of that
House, which he himself came to destroy,
and which he permitted, I may say commanded,
to be filthily polluted not long
after. But not to form by my self an
Invective against the Letter of this Story,
let's hear what the Fathers say to it,</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Origen</i> makes the whole but a<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Parable. His allegorical Expositions of
it, are frequent, and one time or other
he gives us the mystical Meaning of every
Part of it. By the <i>Temple</i>, he understands
the Church: By the <i>Sellers</i> in
the Temple, he means such <i>Preachers</i>
who make Merchandize of the Gospel,
whom the Spirit of Christ, some time or
other, would rid his Church of. He is
so far from believing any thing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Letter of this Story, that he has form'd
a<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> large Argument against it: The
Substance of which is, that if <i>Jesus</i> had
attempted any such thing, the People
would have resisted, and executed their
Revenge on him; if he had effected it, the
Merchants of the Temple might have reproach'd
him with Damage done to their
Wares; and would have justly accused
him of a Riot against Law and Authority.
Whether there is not Reason in
this Argument of <i>Origen</i>, let any one
judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>St. <i>Hilary</i> is of the same Mind with
<i>Origen</i>. He says that this Story is only a<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
Pr&aelig;figuration of what will be done
in Christ's Church upon another Occasion.
And he admonishes<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> us to search into
the profound and mystical Import of every
Part of it; particularly he hints that<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
by <i>the Seats of those who sell Doves</i>, may
be understood the Pulpits of Preachers
who make Sale of the Gifts of the Spirit,
which is represented by a Dove. As to
the Letter of the Story, he is plain enough,
that there was no such<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Market kept
in the Temple of <i>Jerusalem</i>: And if any
Historians besides the <i>Evangelists</i> had asserted
it, I know of none, who would have
been so foolish as to believe that Oxen and
Sheep and Goats were there sold.</p>

<p>St. <i>Ambrose</i> too is for the Mystery, and
against the Letter of this Story, saying<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
what should be the Reason that <i>Jesus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
should overturn the Seats of those that sold
Doves? This must be, says he, a figurative
Story, and signifies nothing less than
the future Ejection of Priests out of his
Church, who shall make Gain and Merchandize
of the Gospel.</p>

<p>St. <i>Jerome</i>, as his manner is in other
Cases, gives us a literal Exposition of
this Miracle, as far as it will bear it: But
then corrects himself again, saying, there
are<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>Absurdities in the Letter; but,
according to its mystical Meaning, <i>Jesus</i>
will enter his Temple of the Church, and
cast out of it Bishops, Priests, and Deacons,
who make a Trade of Preaching. And in
another Place he tells us of the mystical<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Whip, that <i>Jesus</i> will make use of
to this Purpose.</p>

<p>St. <i>Augustin</i> also is against the Letter
of the Story of this Miracle, saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Where could be the great Sin of selling
and buying Things in the Temple, that
were for the Use of it, and offer'd as Sacrifice
in it? We must therefore, says he,
look for the Mystery in this<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> figurative
Story, and enquire what is meant by
the Oxen, and Sheep, and Doves, and who
are the Sellers of them in Christ's Church;
and he is very positive that Ecclesiasticks,
who are selfish, and make worldly Gain
of the Gospel, are here meant. And as to
the Expression of <i>turning the Temple into
a Den of Thieves</i>, he says it has Respect
to the<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><i>Clergy</i> in Time to come, who
would make such a Den of Christ's Church.</p>

<p>Lastly, with the foregoing Fathers agrees
St. <i>Theophylact</i>, who is an Allegorist too
upon this Miracle, saying, that those<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
who sell Doves, are the Priests who sell
spiritual Gifts; and that Christ sometime
or other would overturn their Seats, and
clear his Church of them. In another Place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
he intimates what are meant by Oxen and
Sheep, <i>viz.</i> the literal Sense of the Scriptures.
And if the literal Sense be irrational
and nonsensical, the Metaphor we must
allow to be proper, inasmuch as now-a-days,
dull and foolish and absurd stuff we
call Bulls, Fatlings, and Blunders.</p>

<p>Behold a wonderful Harmony among the
Fathers in their Rejection of the literal,
and Espousal of the mystical Sense of this
Miracle. It is said of the Church in her
first Ages, that she was inspired; and so
she was, or before an Hire for the Priesthood
was established, and pleaded for, she
could never have written in this Fashion.
If the Fathers had lived now, and written
thus, we should have thought the Spirit
of <i>Quakerism</i> was gotten amongst them, or
they would never have given such an Exposition
of this Story to favour an Enmity
to an <i>Hireling Priesthood</i>.</p>

<p>How and when Christ's Power, according
to the Figure and Parable before us,
will enter his Church, and drive out of
her these ecclesiastical Merchants, is not
the Question. But when ever it does so
effectually, it will be a stupendous Miracle,
much greater than the typical one is
supposed to be; and not only a Proof of
Christ's divine Power and Presence in his
Church, but an absolute Demonstration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
his <i>Messiahship</i> from his Accomplishment
both of the foresaid Prophecies of the Fathers,
and of other remarkable ones of the
<i>Old Testament</i>, which will be then clearly
understood, and which it is not my Business
here to apply or mention.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Against the aforesaid Exposition of this
Miracle, perhaps it may be objected, that
(excepting a little Reasoning against the
Letter of it) this is only the chimerical and
whimsical Dream of the Fathers, whose
Notions are obsolete, and who<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> <i>have
adulterated Christianity with their Cant
and Jargon</i>; and that none of our <i>Protestant</i>
and Orthodox <i>Divines</i> have ever given
into their Opinion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I confess, that none of our Protestant
<i>Divines</i>, whom I know do embrace the
foresaid Exposition of the Fathers, but it
may be nothing the worse for all that:
And tho' their Exposition may be very disagreeable
to the Priesthood of this Age,
yet I can tell them of the greatest Man of
these last Ages, and that was <i>Erasmus</i>,
who, cautiously expressing himself for fear
of giving Offence to the <i>Clergy</i>, is of the
same Mind with the Fathers; or he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
not say that<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> <i>that Work of</i> Jesus <i>did
prefigure somewhat else: For</i> Jesus <i>could
not be zealous against the Prophanation
of that Temple of the</i> Jews, <i>which was
soon to be destroy'd, but meant to shew his
Dislike and Hatred of ecclesiastical Covetousness,
which, after the Way of the
Type, he would take his Opportunity to
rid the Church of.</i></p>

<p>Before I dismiss this Miracle, I must observe,
that if the Fathers are right above,
then our <i>Latin</i> and <i>English</i> Translations
of the Place in St. <i>Matthew</i> err in a main
Point. Instead of reading, <i>and Jesus cast
out them that sold and bought</i>, it should
be, <i>those who sold and preach'd</i>; that is
sold what they preach'd: For the Word
αγοραζειν, does more properly signify to
<i>preach</i> than to <i>buy</i>; and in this Sense
here, according to the Fathers, it should
be construed.</p>

<p>Again, I must observe, that our Commentators
are a little perplex'd to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
who, and what those κολλυβιστων, <i>Money-Changers</i>,
were. The Greek<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Word
does import those who have a Knack to
barter away little base and Brass Money,
with the Effigies of an Ox or Bull on it,
in exchange for good Coin. How applicable
the Word was to any Merchants of
the old Temple at <i>Jerusalem</i>, is hard to
conceive. But it is very agreeable to our
ecclesiastical <i>Collybists</i>, who, as I may appeal
to Freethinkers, vend their brasen-faced
Bulls and Blunders at an extravagant
and great Price. And if τραπεζας, which is
translated <i>Tables</i>, does properly signify<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
<i>Pulpits</i>, who can help it?</p>

<p>So much then on the Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>'s
driving the <i>Sellers</i> and <i>Buyers</i> out of the
Temple. And how I appeal to our <i>Divines</i>,
whether it be not an absurd, improbable,
and incredible Story according to
the Letter, and whether it be any other
than, as the Fathers said of it, a prophetical
and parabolical Narrative of what
would be mysteriously and more wonderfully
done by <i>Jesus</i>. And so I come to
speak to a</p>

<p>2. Second Miracle of Jesus, and that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that of his<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> <i>casting the Devils out of
the Madman or Madmen, and permitting
them to enter into the Herd of Swine,
which thereupon ran down a Precipice,
and were all choaked in the Sea</i>.</p>

<p>To exorcise, or cast Devils out of the
Possess'd, without considering the Nature
of such a Possession, or the Nature and
Power of the Devil, we'll allow to be not
only a kind and beneficent Act, but a great
Miracle. But then, be the Miracle as great
as can be imagined, it is no more than what
false Teachers,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a><i>Workers of Iniquity</i>,
and even some Artists amongst the <i>Jews</i>,
have done before; consequently, such a
work of <i>Exorcism</i> in our Saviour, could
be no Proof of his divine Authority. And
if there was no more to be said against this
Miracle, this is enough to set it aside, and
to spoil the Argument of <i>Jesus</i>'s divine
Power from it. But there are many Circumstances
in the Story literally consider'd,
that would induce us to call the Truth of
the whole into question. How came those
Madmen to have their Dwelling amongst
the Tombs of a Burying-Ground? Where
was the Humanity of the People, that did
not take Care of them, in Pity to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
as well as for the Safety of others? Or if
no Chains, as the Text says, which is
hardly credible, could hold them, it was
possible surely, as well as lawful, to dispatch
them, rather than their Neighbours
and Passengers should be in Danger from
them. Believe then this Part of the Story
who can? But what's worse, its not credible
there was any Herd of <i>Swine</i> in that
Country. If any Historians but the <i>Evangelists</i>
had said so, none would have believed
it. The <i>Jews</i> are forbidden to eat
Swine's Flesh; what then should they do
with Swine (which are good for nothing
till they are dead) who eat neither <i>Pig</i>,
<i>Pork</i>, nor <i>Bacon</i>? Some may say that
they were kept there for the Use of Strangers:
but this could not be; because that
after the Time of <i>Antiochus</i>, who polluted
the Temple with the Sacrifice of an Hog,
the <i>Jews</i><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> forbad, under the Pain of
an <i>Anathema</i>, the keeping of any <i>Swine</i>
in their Country. Perhaps it may be said,
that the <i>Gadarens</i>, so call'd from the
Place of their Abode, were not <i>Jews</i>,
but neighbouring <i>Gentiles</i>, with whom it
was lawful to eat, and keep <i>Swine</i>. We
will suppose so, tho' it is improbable; but
then its unlikely (without better Reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
than at present we are apprised of) that
our Saviour would permit the Devils to
enter into a Herd of them to their Destruction.
Where was the Goodness and Justice
of his so doing? Let our <i>Divines</i> account
for it if they can. It is commonly
said of our Saviour, and I believe it, that
his Life was entirely innocent, that his
Miracles were all useful and beneficial to
Mankind, and that he did no Wrong to
any one. But how can this be rightly said
of him, if this Story be literally true? The
Proprietors of the Swine were great Losers
and Sufferers; and we don't read that <i>Jesus</i>
made them amends, or that they deserv'd
such Usage from him. The Proprietors
of the Swine, it seems upon this
Damage done them by <i>Jesus</i>, desire him to
depart out of their Coasts, to prevent farther
Mischief; which was gentler Resentment,
then we can imagine any others
would have made of the like Injury. I
know not what our <i>Divines</i> think of this
Part of the Story, nor wherefore <i>Jesus</i>
escaped so well; but if any <i>Exorcist</i> in this
our Age and Nation, had pretended to expel
the Devil out of one possess'd, and permitted
him to enter into a Flock of Sheep,
the People would have said that he had
bewitch'd both; and our Laws and Judges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
too of the last Age, would have made him
to swing for it.</p>

<p>Without Offence, I hope, I have argued
against the Letter of this strange Story of
the holy <i>Jesus</i>; I should not have dared
to have said so much against it, but upon
the Encouragement of <i>Origen</i> and other
Fathers, who say, we ought to expose the
Absurdities of the Letter, as much as may
be, to turn Men's Heads to the mystical
and true Meaning.</p>

<p>Let's hear then what the Fathers say to
this Miracle. <i>Origen</i>'s Commentaries on
this Part of St. <i>Matthew</i>, and St. <i>Luke</i>'s
Gospel, are lost; otherwise unquestionably
he would not only have told us, that he
believed no more of the Letter of this Story,
than he did of the Devil's<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>taking
our Saviour to the Top of a Mountain,
and shewing him all the Kingdoms of the
World; but, as he is an admirable <i>Mystist</i>,
would have given us curious Light into
the Allegory and Mystery of it. But without
<i>Origen</i>, we have enough in the other
Fathers against the Letter of this Story.</p>

<p>St. <i>Hilary</i> reckoning up all the Parts of
this Miracle together, says of it, that it is<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
typical and parabolical, and written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
for our Meditation of what would be done
hereafter by the holy <i>Jesus</i>. According
to him, and other Fathers, the <i>Madman</i>
is Mankind; or if they were two, they
were <i>Jew</i> and <i>Gentile</i> at Christ's coming,
who may be said to<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> be <i>possess'd with
Devils</i>, in as much as they were under
the Rule of diabolical Sins, and subject to
the Worship of Δαιμονιων, false Deities, which
we translate <i>Devils</i>. They were <i>so fierce</i><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
<i>as no Chains could hold them</i>, because
of their most furious Rage and Enmity
to the Church, whom no Bonds of
Reason could restrain from doing Violence
to the Christians. They are said <i>to be</i><a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
<i>naked</i>, because they were destitute of the
Clothing of the Spirit, and of Grace. And
may be said to be <i>among the</i><a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> <i>Tombs</i>;
because they were dead in Traspasses and
Sins. After that <i>Jesus</i> had exorcis'd these
diabolical Spirits out of the <i>Gentiles</i>, and
brought them to their right Senses, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
was upon their Conversion to the Faith;
then a <i>good Way off</i>, some Ages after, did
the like <i>Devils</i>, by divine Permission, enter
into a<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> <i>Herd of Swine</i>, i. e. into <i>Hereticks</i>
of impure Lives and furious Natures.
What sort of <i>Hereticks</i> are meant,
or whether they are not to be understood
of Christians In general, let our <i>Divines</i>
consider. But one would be apt to think
that <i>Ministers of the Letter</i> are included,
because the <i>Letter</i> of the Scripture is mystically
call'd<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> <i>Swines</i> Food. I am not
obliged to pursue the mystical Interpretation
of this Parable (for so I will call it)
thro' all its Parts, nor to say what is meant
by the Sea, that the <i>Swine</i> are to be absorp't
in; but leave our <i>Divines</i> to chew upon
this mystical Construction given them in
part, and to consider, whether there's not
a Necessity for such an Interpretation to
make the Story credible.</p>

<p>And thus have I given you the Opinion
and Exposition of the Fathers upon this
Miracle, which they turn all into Mystery.
If our <i>Divines</i> are still far adhering to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Letter of this Story, let them account for
the Difficulties it is involv'd with. To cure
Men violently distracted, and possess'd with
<i>Devils</i>, is, whether it be miraculous or not,
a good and great Work; but to send the
<i>Devils</i>, who without <i>Jesus</i>'s Permission
could not go into the <i>Herd of Swine</i>, was
an Injury done to the Proprietors, and unbecoming
of the Goodness of the holy <i>Jesus</i>.
Neither is there any other Way to
solve the Difficulty, than by looking upon
the whole, with the Fathers, as Type and
Figure.</p>

<p>If this miraculous Story had been recorded
of <i>Mahomet</i>, and not of <i>Jesus</i>, our <i>Divines</i>,
I dare say, would have work'd it
up to a Confutation of <i>Mahometanism</i>.
<i>Mahomet</i> should have been, with them,
nothing less than a <i>Wizard</i>, an <i>Enchanter</i>,
a <i>Dealer</i> with familiar Spirits, a sworn
<i>Slave</i> to the Devil; and his <i>Mussulmen</i>
would have been hard put to it to write a
good Defence of him.</p>

<p>When our Saviour was brought before
<i>Pilate</i> to be arraign'd, try'd, and condemned,
<i>Pilate</i> put this Question to the <i>Jews</i>,
saying, <i>What Evil hath Jesus done?</i> If
both, or either of the Stories above, had
been literally true of <i>Jesus</i>, there had been
no need of false Witnesses against him. The
Merchants of the Temple were at hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
who could have sworn "that he was the
Author of an Uproar and Riot, the like
was never seen on their Market-Day;
that they were great Sufferers, and Losers
in their Trades; and, whether he
or his Party had stolen any of their
Goods or not, yet some were embezzled,
and others damaged; and all thro'
the outragious Violence of this unruly
Fellow, against Law and Authority."
If such Evidence as this was not enough
to convict him of a capital Crime, then
the <i>Swine-Herds</i> of the <i>Gadarenes</i> might
have deposed, "how they believed him to
be a <i>Wizard</i>, and had lost two thousand
Swine through his Fascinations:
That he bid the Devils to go into our
Cattle, is not to be deny'd. And if he
cured one or two of our Countrymen
of a violent Possession, yet in as much as
he did us this Injury in our Swine, we
justly suspect him of diabolical Practices
upon both."</p>

<p>Upon such Evidence as this, <i>Pilate</i> asks the
Opinion of the <i>Jews</i>, saying, <i>What think
you?</i> If they all had condemn'd him to be
guilty of Death, it is no wonder, since
there is not a <i>Jury</i> in <i>England</i> would
have acquitted any one arraign'd and accused
in the like Case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well for our literal <i>Doctors</i>, that
such Accusations were not brought against
<i>Jesus</i>; or their Heads would have been
sadly puzzled to vindicate his Innocence,
and to prove the Injustice and Undeservedness
of his Death and Sufferings. But for
this Reason, if no other, that no such
Crimes were laid to his Charge, I believe
little or nothing of either of the seemingly
miraculous Stories before us, but look upon
them both as prophetical and parabolical
Narratives of what would mysteriously and
more wonderfully, and consistently with
the Wisdom and Goodness of <i>Jesus</i>, be
done by him. And so I pass to a</p>

<p>3. Third Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>, and that is
<i>his Transfiguration</i><a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> <i>on the Mount</i>.
And this is the darkest and blindest Story
of the whole Gospel, which a Man can
make neither Head nor Foot of; and I
question whether the Conceptions of any
two thinking <i>Doctors</i> do agree about it.
To say there is nothing in the Letter of
this Story, we Believers must not, because
St. <i>Peter</i><a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> says he was an Eye-witness
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Majesty, saw his Glory on the
Mount, and heard the Voice out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Cloud. But as Infidels will be prying into
the Conduct of <i>Jesus</i>'s Life, and forming
their Exceptions to the Credibility or
Probability of this or that part of it, so we
Christians should be ready at an Answer,
that might reasonably satisfy them; and
not forcibly bear down their Opposition,
which will make no sincere Converts of
them. And I believe they would easily
distress us with Difficulties and Objections
to the Letter of this Story.</p>

<p>St. <i>Augustin</i> himself<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> owns, that the
whole of it might be perform'd by Magic
Art; and we know, in these our Days,
that some Jugglers are strange Artists at
the Imitation of a Voice, and to make it
as if it came from a far off, when it is uttered
close by us, and can cast themselves
too into different Forms and Shapes, without
a Miracle, to the Surprise and Admiration
of Spectators.</p>

<p>But what, I trow, do our <i>Divines</i> mean
by <i>Jesus</i>'s <i>Transfiguration</i>. We read that
his Countenance did shine like the Sun,
and his Raiment was made as white as
Snow, and that's all. And is this enough
can we think, to demonstrate that Transaction,
a miraculous <i>Transfiguration</i>? Philosophers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
will tell us, that the Reflections
of the Light of the Sun will change the
Appearance of Colours, and to none more
than Whiteness; and <i>Sceptics</i> will say, that
its no Wonder if the Countenance of <i>Jesus</i>
look'd <i>Rubicund</i>, when the Sun might
shine on it.</p>

<p>The Word in the Original for <i>transfigured</i>,
is μεταμορφωθη, that is, he was metamorphosed,
transform'd, or, if you will,
transfigured. And what is to be understood
by a <i>Metamorphosis</i>, we are to learn
not only from the natural Import of the
Word, but from the ancient Use of it.
Accordingly, it signifies nothing less than
the Change or Transformation of a Person
into the Forms, Shapes, and Essences of
Creatures and Things of a quite different
Species, Size, and Figure: But <i>Jesus</i>, it
is conceived, was not so <i>transfigured</i>. Our
<i>Divines</i>, I suppose, would not have him
thought such a <i>Posture-Master</i> for the
whole World. If I, or anyone else, should
assert, that <i>Jesus</i> upon the Mount transform'd
himself into a Calf, a Lyon, a Bear,
a Ram, a Goat, an Hydra, a Stone, a Tree,
and into many other Things of the animate
and inanimate World, I dare say there
would, among our orthodox <i>Divines</i>, be
such Exclamations against me for Blasphemy,
as the like were never heard of. They,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to be sure, will not hear of such a Transfiguration;
nor, like good plain believers,
will bear any thing more than that <i>Jesus</i>'s
<i>Countenance did shine</i> like the Sun, and
the Colour of his Vestments was changed;
which whether it comes up to the Import
of a <i>Metamorphosis</i> or not, they don't care.</p>

<p>But to close with our <i>Divines</i>, and acknowledge
that the glorious Change of
<i>Jesus</i>'s Countenance, and of the Colour of
his Vestments, was a true and proper Transfiguration,
and that it was as real and
wonderful a Miracle as could be wrought:
But then we may, I hope, ask them, what
was the particular Reason and Use of this
Miracle? Was it a Miracle only for the
sake of a Miracle? That's an Absurdity in
the Opinion of<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> St. <i>Augustin</i>, who says,
what is reasonable to think, that all and
every one of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles had its particular
End and Use; or he who is the
Wisdom as well as Power of God, had never
wrought them. And what, I pray, was
the life of this Miracle? Of that the evangelical
History is silent, and our <i>Divines</i>,
with all their reasoning Faculties, can say
nothing to it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>And what did <i>Moses</i> and <i>Elias</i> on the
Mount with <i>Jesus</i>? Was it in their own
proper Persons that they appear'd? or were
they only some Spectres and Apparitions in
resemblance of them? It is said, that they
were talking with <i>Jesus</i>; what then did
they talk about? The three greatest Prophets
and Philosophers of the Universe
could not possibly meet and confer together,
but on the most sublime, useful, and edifying
Subject. Its strange that the Apostles,
who over-heard their Confabulation, did
not make a Report of it, and transmit it to
Posterity for our Edification and Instruction.
St. <i>Luke</i>, as our <i>English</i> Translation has it,
seems to say that they talk'd together of
<i>Jesus</i>'s <i>Decease which he should accomplish
at Jerusalem</i>; but this can't be the
Meaning of St. <i>Luke</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Words, which
so interpreted, are no less than a <i>Barbarism</i>,
and, I appeal to our Greek <i>Criticks</i>,
an Improper Expression of such Signification.
We must then look for a more proper
Construction of the Phrase in St. <i>Luke</i>,
or we must remain in the Dark, as to the
Subject, that <i>Moses</i> and <i>Elias</i> talked with
<i>Jesus</i> about.</p>

<p>But further, Why could not this Miracle
have been wrought in the Valley as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
well as upon a Mountain, whither <i>Jesus</i>
and his three Apostles ascended for the
Work of it? Naughty <i>Infidels</i> will say, it
was for the Advantage of a Cloud, which
often moves and rests on the Tops of Mountains,
to display his Pranks in. And why
was it not done in the Presence of the Multitude,
as well as of his three Apostles? The
more Witnesses of a Miracle, the better it
is attested, and the more reasonably credited;
and there could not surely be too
many Witnesses of this, any more than of
others of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, if real ones.
Ought not the unbelieving Multitude, for
many Unbelievers unquestionably were amongst
them, to have had a Sight and
Hearing of this Miracle, as well as the
Apostles? Who should rather see the Miracle,
than those who wanted Conviction?
Were they to take the Report of the Miracle
upon the Word of the Apostles, who
were Parties in the Cause? Our <i>Divines</i>
may possibly say they ought: But <i>Infidels</i>
and <i>Free-Thinkers</i> would cry out against
them, for juggling Tricks, and pious Impostures.</p>

<p>These are all Difficulties and hard Questions
about the Miracle of Christ's Transfiguration,
which our <i>Clergy</i>, who are Admirers
of the Letter of that Story, are
obliged to account for; and I believe it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
will be long enough before they give a
proper and satisfactory Answer to many of
them.</p>

<p>Let's hear then what the Fathers say to
this miraculous Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s Transfiguration.
And it is agreed amongst them,
that the whole is but a Type,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Prefiguration,
and<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> &aelig;nigmatical Resemblance
of a future and more glorious and
real Transfiguration. And whenever they
speak of any Part of the Story, they never
explain to us how the Matter went upon
Mount <i>Tabor</i>, but tell us of what <i>this</i> or
<i>that</i> Part of it is figurative and emblematical;
and how it is to be understood, and
will be fulfill'd in future Time. As thus,
by <i>the</i><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> <i>six Days</i>, they understood six
Ages of the World, after which a real and
mysterious Transfiguration will be exhibited
to our intellectual Views. By <i>Moses</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and <i>Elias</i><a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> talking with <i>Jesus</i>, they
mean the Law and the Prophets, upon an
allegorical Interpretation, bearing Testimony
unto Christ as the Fulfiller of them.
By the<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> <i>Mountain</i> on which this future
Transfiguration will be exhibited, they
understand the sublime and anagogical
Sense of the Law and the Prophets. By
his <i>Transfiguration</i> it self, they mean his
taking upon him, and passing through the
Forms of all the Types of him under the
Law, as of a Lamb, a Lion, a Serpent, a
Calf, a Rock, a Stone, and of many others,
which he is to fulfil, and which will
then be clearly discern'd by us. By the
black Cloud<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> that at present obstructs
this Vision, they understand the Letter of
the Old Testament. By the white<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Vestments of <i>Jesus</i>, they mean the Words
of the Scriptures, which will then shine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
clear and bright. By the Voice out of the
Cloud, they mean, with St. <i>Peter</i>, the
Word of Prophecy, that will sound in the
Ears of our Apprehensions. And lastly,
they tell us, that the Way to attain to the
Sight of this glorious Vision, is by ascending
(not by local Motion, but by Reason)
to the Tops of the Mountain of the mysterious
and sublime Sense of the Law and the
Prophets. If we continue in the Plains
and Vallies<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of the Letter, like the
Multitude under the Mountain, we shall
never see <i>Jesus</i> in his shining Vestments,
nor how he was transform'd into the Types
of the Law; nor <i>Moses</i> and <i>Elias</i> talking
with him; nor the Law and the Prophets
agreeing harmoniously in a Testimony to
him.</p>

<p>After this fashion do the Fathers, one or
other of them, copiously treat on every
Part of this Transfiguration of <i>Jesus</i>. I
could collect an almost infinite Number of
Passages out of their Writings to this Purpose:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
But from these few it is plain, they
look'd on the Story of Christ's Transfiguration,
but as a Figure and Parable; and
they were certainly in the right on't, in as
much as this their Sense of the Matter, and
no other, will solve the Difficulties before
started against the Letter, as any one may
discern, if he attentively review and compare
one with the other: As, for instance,
this their Sense and Interpretation lets us
into the Reason of <i>Moses</i> and <i>Elias</i>'s appearing
on the Mount with <i>Jesus</i>; and
gives us to understand what they talk'd
about, and that was, not on <i>Jesus</i>'s <i>Decease
which he would accomplish at</i> Jerusalem,
as our Translation has it, but on the
Prophecy of the Old Testament; particularly,
as St. <i>Luke</i> says, on <i>Moses</i>'s Book of
<i>Exodus, and how he would fulfill it</i> at the
New Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Whether any, besides my self, does really
apprehend, and is willing to understand
this Story of Christ's Transfiguration, as I
do, I neither know nor care. I am not
bound to find others Ears, Eyes, and Capacities.
What I have said is enough to
shew the Sense of the Fathers about this
Matter. If any dislike their concurrent
Opinion of <i>Jesus</i>'s Transfiguration's being
an Emblem, an Enigma, and figurative
Representation of a future and most glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Transfiguration, such a one as they
speak of; let him account for the Difficulties
and Objections which I have before
raised against the Letter of this Story. In
the mean time I shall think it, literally, an
absurd, improbable, and incredible one,
and no other than a prophetical and parabolical
Narrative of what will be mysteriously
and more wonderfully done by <i>Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>And thus I have considered <i>three</i> of the
Miracles of our Saviour, and shewn how
they are Absurdities, according to the Letter,
consequently do make nothing for his
Authority and <i>Messiahship</i>. I can and will
do as much by his other Miracles; for I
would not have any one think I am gotten
to the End of my Tedder, but for some
Reasons best known to my self, I publish
these Remarks on these three first. After
the <i>Clergy</i> have chew'd upon these a while,
I will take into Examination some others
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, which for their literal
Story are admired by them. As for Instance,</p>

<p>I will take to task his Miracle<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> <i>of
changing Water into Wine at a Marriage
in Cana of Galilee</i>; which was the beginning
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, and should by
right have been first spoken to; but I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
almost too grave to handle the Letter of
this Story as I ought; and if I had treated
it as ludicrously as it deserves, I don't know
but at setting out, I should have put the
<i>Clergy</i> quite out of all Temper. I would
not now for the World be so impious and
profane, as to believe, with our <i>Divines</i>,
what is contain'd and imply'd in the Letter
of this Story. If <i>Apollonius Tyan&aelig;us</i>, and
not <i>Jesus</i>, had been the Author of this
Miracle, we should often have reproached
his Memory with it. It is said of <i>Apollonius
Tyan&aelig;us</i>, that a Table was all on a
sudden, at his Command, miraculously
spread with Variety of nice Dishes for the
Entertainment of himself and his Guests;
which Miracle, our <i>Divines</i> can tell him,
makes not at all to his Credit, in as much
as it was done for the Service and Pleasure
of luxurious Appetites. But if <i>Apollonius</i>
had done, as our <i>Jesus</i> did at this Wedding,
they would have said much worse
of him; and that, modestly speaking, he
delighted to make his Friends thoroughly
merry, or he would not be at the Pains of
a Miracle to turn so much Water into
Wine, after they had before <i>well drank</i>.
If the Fathers then don't help us out at the
mystical and true Meaning of this Miracle,
such farther Objections may be form'd against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the Letter, as may make our <i>Divines</i>
asham'd of it.</p>

<p>I will also take into Examination <i>Jesus</i>'s
Miracle<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> of <i>feeding many Thousands
in the Wilderness with a few Loaves and
Fishes</i>; which, according to the Letter, are
most romantick Tales. I don't in the least
question <i>Jesus</i>'s Power to magnify or multiply
the Loaves, and, if he pleass'd, to meliorate
the Bread: But that many Thousands
of Men, Women, and Children,
should follow him into the Wilderness,
and stay with him three Days and Nights
too, without eating, is a little against Sense
and Reason. Whether the Wilderness was
near to, or far from the People's Habitations,
the Difficulties attending the Story
are equally great. I wonder how <i>Jesus</i>
amused them all the while, that they had
the Patience to stay with him without
Food; but I much more wonder, that no
Victuallers besides the <i>Lad</i> with his Loaves
and Fishes, of whom, and his Occupation,
whether it was that of a <i>Baker</i> or <i>Fishmonger</i>;
and of his Neglect of his Master's
Business here; and of the Reason that he
met with no hungry Chapmen for his
Bread before, we shall make some Enquiry;
but particularly why he alone, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
say, and no other Victuallers, no other Retalers
of Cakes and Gingerbread followed
the Camp. In short, for all the imaginary
Greatness of the Miracle (which there is a
way to reduce and lessen) of <i>Jesus</i>'s feeding
his Thousands with a few Loaves, there
must be some Fascination or Enchantment
(condemn'd by the Laws of the <i>Jews</i> as
well as of other Nations) in the Matter;
or the People if they had stay'd one Day,
would not two, much less three <i>to faint</i>,
but would, especially the Women and Children,
have been for returning the first
Night home. We must then seek to the
Fathers (who say the five Books of <i>Moses</i>
are the <i>five Barley Loaves</i>, &amp;c. and the
septiform'd Spirit, the <i>seven Loaves</i>, &amp;c.)
for a good Notion of this Miracle, and if
they don't make it a Parable; do what our
<i>Divines</i> can, it will turn to the Dishonour
of the holy Jesus.</p>

<p>I will also consider the Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
<i>curing the Man sick of the Palsy, for
whom the Roof of the House was broken
up, to let him down into the Room where</i>
Jesus <i>was, because his Bearers could not
enter in at the Door for the Press of the
People</i>. This literally is such a <i>Rodomontado</i>,
that were Men to stretch for a Wager,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
against Reason and Truth, none could
out-do it. Where was the Humanity of
the People, and wherefore did they so tumultuate
against the Door of the House?
Its <i>strange</i> they had not so much Compassion
on the <i>Paralytick</i>, as to give way to
him: Its <i>more strange</i> that his Bearers
could get to the Top of the House with
him and his Bed too, when they could not
get to the Door, nor the Sides of it: Its
<i>yet stranger</i>, that the good Man of the
House would suffer his House to be broken
up, when it could not be long ere the
Tumult of the People would be appeas'd:
But most <i>strange</i>, that <i>Jesus</i>, who could
drive his thousands out at the Temple before
him, and draw as many after him into
the Wilderness, did not, by Force or
Persuasion, make the People to retreat, but
that such needless Trouble and Pains must
be taken for the miraculous Cure of this
poor Man. Let's think of these Things
against the Time, that out of the Fathers I
prove this Story to be a Parable.</p>

<p>I will also take into Consideration the
Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>'s curing <i>the</i><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> <i>blind
Man, for whom Eye-Salve was made of
Clay and Spittle</i>; which Eye-Salve, whether
it was balsamick or not, does equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
affect the Credit of the Miracle. If it was
naturally medicinal, there's an End of the
Miracle; and if it was not at all medicinal,
it was foolishly and impertinently apply'd,
and can be no otherwise accounted for,
than by considering it, with the Fathers,
as a figurative Act in <i>Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>I will also take into Consideration the
several Stories of <i>Jesus</i>'s raising of the
Dead; and, without questioning his actual
bringing of the Dead to Life again, will
prove from the Circumstances of those Stories,
that they are parabolical, and are not
literally to be apply'd to the Proof of <i>Jesus</i>'s
divine Authority and Messiahship; or, for
Instance, <i>Jesus</i>, when he raised <i>Jairus</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
Daughter from the Dead, would never
have turned the People out of the
House, who should have been his best and
properest Witnesses.</p>

<p>I will also consider the Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
<i>cursing the Fig-Tree</i>, for its not bearing
Fruit out of Season; which, upon the
bare mention of it, appears to be a foolish,
absurd, and ridiculous Act, if not figurative.</p>

<p>I will also consider the<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Journey of
the Wisemen out of the East, with their (literally)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
senseless and ridiculous Presents of
<i>Frankincense</i> and <i>Myrrhe</i>, to a new-born
Babe. If with their <i>Gold</i>, which could be
but little, they had brought their <i>Dozens</i>
of Sugar, Soap, and Candles, which would
have been of Use to the Child and his poor
Mother in the Straw, they had acted like
wise as well as good Men. But what, I
pray, was the Meaning and Reason of a
Star, like a <i>Will-a-Whisp</i>, for their Guide
to the Place, where the holy Infant lay.
Could not God, by divine Impulse, in a
Vision or in a Dream, as he ordered their
Return home, have sent them on this important
Errand; but that a Star must be
taken or made out of Course to this Purpose?
I wonder what Communication passed
between these Wisemen and the Star, or
how they came to know one anothers Use
and Intention. But the Fathers shall speak
hereafter farther to the Senselessness of this
Story literally, and make out the Mystery
and true Meaning of it.</p>

<p>I will also, by the Leave of our <i>Divines</i>,
take again into Consideration the
miraculous Conception of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>,
and the Resurrection of <i>Jesus</i> from the
Dead. I do believe, if it may so please
our <i>Divines</i>, that <i>Jesus</i> was born of a
pure Virgin, and that he arose from the
Dead: But speaking too briefly, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<i>Moderator</i>, to these two Miracles, they
took Offence. I will therefore give them
a Review, and speak home to them; particularly
to Christ's Resurrection, the evangelical
Story of which literally, is such
a Complication of Absurdities, Incoherences,
and Contradictions, that unless the
Fathers can help us to a better Understanding
of the <i>Evangelists</i> than we have at present,
we must of Necessity give up the
Belief of it.</p>

<p>These and many<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> other of the historical
and miraculous Parts of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Life, will I take into Examination, and
shew, that none of them literally do prove
his divine Authority: so far from it, that
they are full of Absurdities, Improbabilities,
and Incredibilities; but that his whole
Life in the Flesh, is but<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Type, Figure,
and Parable of his mysterious and
spiritual Life and Operations in Mankind.</p>

<p>In the End of this Head, it will be a
curious and diverting Subject to examine
the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i> as they are literally
understood, by the Notions which our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<i>Divines</i> have advanced about Miracles;
and to shew, that even their Notions compared
with Christ's Miracles, are destructive
of his Authority, and subversive of
Christianity. This, I say, would be a
most diverting Undertaking, and it will
be strange, if some <i>Free-Thinker</i>, that loves
Pleasure of this kind, does not take the
Hint, and snatch the Work out of my
Hands. If I do it my self, I shall have especial
Regard to the Writers against the
<i>Grounds</i>, without passing by Mr. <i>Chandler</i>'s
<i>Essay on Miracles</i>; on which the
more Remarks will be made, if it be but
to pay my Respects to the <i>Archbishop</i>'s
Judgment, and to shew my Admiration at
those extravagant Praises, which his <i>Grace</i>
at <i>Lambeth</i> has bestowed on that Author.
Among other his notable Notions of a Miracle
(and the <i>Archbishop</i> says he has<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
<i>set the Notion of a Miracle upon a clear
and sure Foundation</i>) one is,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> <i>That
Miracles should be Things probable as well
as possible, that they do not carry along
with them the Appearance of Romance
and Fable, which would unavoidably prejudice
Men against believing them</i>. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
is certainly a good and right Notion of a
divine Miracle; and I don't doubt, but
according to it, Mr. <i>Chandler</i> and the
<i>Archbishop</i> think, they can justify the literal
Story of our Saviour's Miracles, against
the Charge of <i>Fable</i> and <i>Romance</i>: But
whether they are able to do it or not, I
shall go on, in some Discourses hereafter
to be publish'd, to prove that our <i>Divines</i>,
by espousing the Letter of Christ's Miracles,
have deceived themselves into the
Belief of the most arrant <i>Quixotism</i> that
can be devis'd and palm'd upon the Understandings
of Mankind. I say, they have
deceived themselves; for neither the Fathers,
nor the Apostles, nor even <i>Jesus</i>
himself, means that his Miracles, as recorded
in the <i>Evangelists</i>, should be taken in
a literal Sense, but in<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> a mystical, figurative,
and parabolical one. And this
should bring me to the</p>

<p>III. Head of my Discourse; that is, to
consider what <i>Jesus</i> means, when he appeals
to his Works and Miracles, as to a
Witness and Testimony of his divine Authority;
and to shew, that he could not
properly and truly refer to those supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
to be wrought by him in the <i>Flesh</i>, but to
those mystical ones he would do in the
<i>Spirit</i>, of which those seemingly wrought
by him in the Flesh, are but Types and
Shadows.</p>

<p>But this Head can't be rightly spoken
to, till I have more amply discuss'd the
former, which, by God's Leave, I promise
to do: And if my <i>courteous Readers</i> will
be so kind as to trust me till that Time, I
assure them to prove, that no Ignorance
and Stupidity can be greater, than the Imagination
that <i>Jesus</i> really appeal'd to his
Miracles, supposed to have been wrought
by him in the Flesh, as to a Witness and
Testimony of his divine Authority, and
<i>Messiahship</i>.</p>

<p>In the mean Time our <i>Divines</i> may go
on in their own Way, if they think fit,
and admire <i>Jesus</i> of old, and celebrate his
Power and Praises for healing of bodily
Diseases, and doing other notable Feats
according to the Letter of the evangelical
Story; but I am for the spiritual <i>Jesus</i> and
<i>Messiah</i>, who cures the worse<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Distempers
of the Soul, and does other mysterious
and most miraculous Works, of
which those recorded in the Evangelists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
are but Figure and Parable. This is the
primitive and concurrent Opinion about the
true <i>Messiah</i>, which the Fathers universally
adher'd to. Whether our <i>Jesus</i>, at
this Day, be such a spiritual <i>Messiah</i> to
his Church, or whether she does not stand
in need of such a one, is the Question that
our <i>Divines</i> are to see to. But I will add
here, what I believe, and than have another
Opportunity to prove, that God on
purpose suffer'd or empower'd <i>false</i> as well
as <i>true</i> Prophets, <i>bad</i> as well as <i>good</i> Men,
such as <i>Apollonius</i>, <i>Vespasian</i>, and many
others to cure Diseases, and to do other
mighty Works, equal to what are literally
reported of <i>Jesus</i>, not only to defeat us of
all distinction between true and false Miracles,
which are the Object of our bodily
Senses, but to raise and keep up our
Thoughts to the constant Contemplation
of <i>Jesus</i>'s spiritual, mysterious, and most
miraculous Works, which are the Object
of our Understandings, and loudly bespeak
the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of
God; and which are to be the absolute
Demonstration of <i>Jesus</i>'s divine Authority
and <i>Messiahship</i> to the Conversion of <i>Jews</i>
and <i>Infidels</i>.</p>

<p>I have no more to do at present, but,
like a <i>Moderator</i>, to conclude with a short
Address and Exhortation to <i>Infidels</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<i>Apostates</i>, the two contending Parties in
the present Controversy. And</p>

<p><i>First</i>, To <i>Apostates</i>, I mean the Writers
against the <i>Grounds</i> and <i>Scheme</i>. Whether
you, <i>grave Sirs</i>, who account your selves
orthodox <i>Divines</i>, tho' there is little but
Contradiction and Inconsistency amongst
you, do like the Name of <i>Apostates</i> which
is given you, I much question: But it is
the properest, I could think of, for your
Desertion of primitive Doctrine about Prophecy
and Miracles. I could, not improperly
have given you a worse <i>Title</i>, but I
was willing to compliment you, rather
than reproach you with this.</p>

<p>But setting aside the Title of <i>Apostates</i>,
whether it be, in your Opinion, opprobrious
or not; you may plainly perceive, that
I am, <i>Sirs</i>, on your Side, as to the Truth
of Christianity; and if you'll accept of my
Assistance for the Proof of <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship
from Prophecy, upon the Terms of
the allegorical Scheme proposed in my
<i>Moderator</i>, you shall find me your hearty
Abettor. Upon the allegorical Scheme, I
don't doubt but we shall soundly drub and
mawl <i>Infidels</i>, and beat them out of the
Field of Battle. If you, being wedded to
the literal Scheme, will not accept of my
Assistance, you may go on in your own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Way, and see the Event of the Controversy,
which in the End will turn to
your Dishonour.</p>

<p>You, <i>Sirs</i>, can't but be sensible, how
those two great Generals, Mr. <i>Grounds</i>,
and Mr. <i>Scheme</i>, with their potent Armies
of Reasons and Authorities against your literal
Prophecies, have grievously distress'd
and gall'd you; and if you don't make an
honourable Retreat in Time, and seek to
<i>Allegorists</i> for Help, will gain a compleat
Victory and Triumph over you.</p>

<p>Instead of the Help of <i>Allegorists</i>, you, I
find, under the Disappointment of your literal
Scheme, chuse rather to have Recourse
to <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles: But what little
Dependence there is upon his Miracles,
in your Sense, I have in <i>part</i> proved in
this Discourse; and this I have done (give
me leave repeatedly to declare it) not for the
Service of your unbelieving Adversaries,
but to reduce you to the good old Way
of interpreting Oracles, which, upon the
Testimony of the Fathers, will, one Day,
be the Conversion of the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>

<p>Whether you, <i>Sirs</i>, will be pleas'd with
this short Discourse on Christ's Miracles,
I much question. But before you put your
selves into a Rage against it, I beg of you
to read St. <i>Theophilus</i> of <i>Antioch</i>, <i>Origen</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
St. <i>Hilary</i>, St. <i>Augustin</i>, St. <i>Ambrose</i>, St.
<i>Jerome</i>, St. <i>Chrysostom</i>, St. <i>John</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i>,
St. <i>Theophylact</i>, and other occasional
ancient Pieces on one part or other of
the <i>Evangelists</i>; and you'll find how they
countenance such a Discourse as this on
Miracles, and will abundantly assist me in
the Prosecution of it.</p>

<p>I expect, <i>Sirs</i>, that some of you will be
ready to rave against me for this Discourse;
but this is my Comfort, that if your Passion
should arise to another Prosecution of
me, you can't possibly separate any of mine
from the Opinions of the Fathers to ground
a Prosecution on: And what Dishonour in
the End will redown to Protestant and pretendedly
learned <i>Divines</i> of the Church
of <i>England</i>, to persecute again the Fathers
for primitive Doctrine, I desire you to think
on.</p>

<p>But, as I suppose, you'll have more Wit,
<i>Sirs</i>, than to prosecute me again for this
Discourse; so I hope you'll have more Ingenuity,
than odiously (after your wonted
manner) to represent me to the Populace,
for Profaneness, Blasphemy, and Infidelity.
If you dislike the whole, or any part of
this Discourse, appear like Men and Scholars,
from the <i>Press</i> against it. Use me as

<p>
<i>Veniam petimus, dabimusq; vicissim.</i><br />
</p>

<p>I desire nothing more than to be furiously
attack'd from the <i>Press</i>, which, if I am not
much mistaken, would give me a long'd for
Opportunity to expose your Ignorance to
more Advantage.</p>

<p>Be not longer mistaken, <i>good Sirs</i>. The
History of <i>Jesus</i>'s Life, as recorded in the
<i>Evangelists</i>, is an emblematical Representation
of his spiritual Life in the Soul of
Man; and his Miracles are Figures of his
mysterious Operations. The four Gospels
are in no Part a literal Story, but a System
of mystical Philosophy or Theology.</p>

<p>If you are resolved not to come into this
Opinion, I beg of you again, before you
break forth into a Passion, to try to vindicate
the literal Story of the three Miracles
spoken to in this Discourse, <i>viz.</i> those of
Jesus'<i>s driving the Buyers and Sellers out
of the Temple; of his exorcising the Devil
out of the Madman; and of his Transfiguration
on the Mount;</i> which if you are able
to defend against the Fathers, and my Objections,
I'll give up the Cause to you, and
own my self (what I am far enough from
being) an impious Infidel and Blasphemer,
and deserving of the worst Punishment. In
the mean time, I make bold again to assert,
that the literal Story of Christ's Life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Miracles, is an absurd and incredible Romance,
full of Contradictions and Inconsistencies;
and that modern Paraphrases
are not only a consequential Reflection on
the Intellects of the <i>Evangelists</i>, and their
divine Gifts of the Spirit, as if they could
not write an intelligible and coherent Piece
of Biography without your Help at this
Distance of Time; but have even darken'd
and obscured the seemingly native Simplicity
of the Story of the Life of <i>Jesus</i>. So
leaving you to chew upon this, I turn</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My Address to <i>Infidels</i>, particularly to
the two most renown'd Writers of the Party,
Mr. <i>Grounds</i>, and Mr. <i>Scheme</i>. I
should, <i>Gentlemen</i>, by right, salute you
with the Title of <i>Free-Thinkers</i>, a proper
Name for your philosophical Sect, who are
for the free Exercise of your Reason about
divine and speculative Points in Theology.
And I had distinguish'd you by this Title
from your apostatical Adversaries, but that
I had a mind to oblige my old Friends the
<i>Clergy</i>, in giving you a no more honourable
Title than I do them. And I trust you
will not be offended at the Title of <i>Infidels</i>,
since not only your Writings seem to
have a Tendency to Infidelity; but, if there
be any Fault in your Principles, you know
how to charge it on your Adversaries, the
pretended Advocates for Christianity, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Absurdities, false Reasonings, Inconsistencies,
and foolish Glosses on the Scriptures,
have occasioned your Departure from the
Faith in Christ.</p>

<p>I thank Mr. <i>Scheme</i> for the noble Present
of his Book, which I received and read
with Pleasure. But instead of one, he
should have sent me a <i>Dozen</i> for the Use
of Friends and Borrowers, who are very
curious and importunate for the Perusal of
it. For what Reason he envies the <i>Booksellers</i>
the publick Sale of his Work, chusing
rather to give it away <i>gratis</i>, than that
they should reap any Profit by it, I know
not. Surely it is not to bring an <i>Odium</i>
on the <i>Clergy</i> for Persecutors, as if such an
useful and philosophical Piece might not
appear publickly without Danger from
them: If so, I hope the <i>Clergy</i> will resent
the Indignity, and invite him to a
Publication of his Book, with a Promise
of Impunity, which would wipe off the
Reproach, which this clandestine Method
of disposing of it has cast on them.</p>

<p>I once almost despair'd, <i>Sirs</i>, of seeing
such another Piece from your Quarter. I
was afraid the Prosecution of the <i>Moderator</i>,
would have deterr'd you from the
Press, whereby our excellent Controversy
on Foot must have been dropt: But the
sudden and unexpected Appearance of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
<i>Scheme</i>, has revived me, and rejoiced the
Cockles of my Heart. Go on then, <i>great
Sirs</i>, in this Controversy, which Mr.
<i>Grounds</i> happily commenc'd; and if you
are deny'd the Liberty of the Press, and
publick Sale of your Books, I hope you'll,
for all that, as occasion offers it self, oblige
the Learned and Curious with some more
of your bright Lucubrations, tho' you print
them, and dispose of them in this clancular
and subtil Method.</p>

<p>It is not that I wish well to your Cause
of Infidelity, that I thus encourage you.
You have more Sense and Reason than to
suspect me tainted with unbelieving Principles.
Christianity will stand its Ground
against your battering Armour; and the
Church of Christ will be the more firmly
establish'd on a Rock of Wisdom, for that
Opposition you make to it. Tho' you will
entirely vanquish the literal <i>Schemists</i>, and
ride in Triumph over them, yet other Defenders
of the Faith, call'd <i>Allegorists</i>, will
arise to your Confutation and final Overthrow.</p>

<p>If I am not mistaken, <i>Sirs</i>, your Adversaries,
the literal <i>Schemists</i>, whom I call
<i>Apostates</i>, are about making a Retreat,
and yielding the Field of Battle to you.
The <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Litchfield</i>, the greatest General
on their Side, will not only find it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
hard to levy any more Forces in Defence
of his <i>twelve</i> literal Prophecies; but he
knows that, if he draws his Sword any
more against you, he must attack too the
Authority of the Fathers for the allegorical
Interpretation of some of those Prophecies,
already urg'd in my <i>Supplements</i> to
the <i>Moderator</i>; or, if the Fathers are neglected
by him; they and I, keeping out of
the Reach of his <i>Bug-Bear</i>, will treat him
with such familiar Language, as never was
given to one of his Order.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Scheme</i> seems to promise us a Discourse
on the Miracles in the Scriptures;
I hope he'll be as good as his Word, and
ere long publish it. This Discourse of
mine can't possibly supersede his. As I
question not but his Thoughts and Remarks
on Miracles will be very considerable; so
I shall be a little impatient till I see them.
But be his Discourse on Miracles of what
Kind soever, I believe it will hardly be an
Obstruction to my Undertaking in Hand,
which I intend, by God's Leave, to go on
with, to the Honour of the holy <i>Jesus</i>,
our spiritual <i>Messiah</i>, to whom be Glory
and Praise for ever and ever. <i>Amen.</i></p>

</div>

<p>our Fame for that celebrated
Book, call'd the <i>Defence of
Christianity</i>, is the Occasion of
this Dedication. I need not tell you,
what vast Reputation you have acquired
by it: You have been not only
often applauded from the Press, but
have met with large Compliments and
Thanks from your Clergy for it. And
tho' Mr. <i>Scheme</i> has very untowardly
written against you, yet this is <i>still</i>
your Honour, that you are an <i>Author</i>,
not unworthy of his Regard and Notice.</p>

<p>I am, in Opinion with the Fathers,
against an establish'd Hire for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv_Book2" id="Page_iv_Book2">[Pg iv]</a></span>
Priesthood, thinking it of disservice to
true Religion: But when I consider'd
the Usefulness of your Lordship's Episcopal
Riches and Honours to this Controversy,
I almost chang'd my Mind.
Your exalted Station in the Church,
has given Credit and Authority to your
Work, which, if it had came from the
Hands of a poor Priest, had never been
so much admir'd; neither would Mr.
<i>Scheme</i>, I believe, nor my self, have paid
so many Respects to it.</p>

<p>For this Reason, I wish some more
of your <i>Order</i> would appear in this Controversy,
that the World might see what
famous Men are our <i>Bishops</i>, and of
what Use their <i>Hundreds</i> and <i>Thousands</i>
a Year are to the Defence of Christianity;
which, if such able Hands were
not amply hired to its Support, might
be in Danger, as certainly as, that Men
of low Fortunes must needs be Men of
poor Parts, little Learning, and slender
Capacities to write in Vindication of it.</p>

<p>Some have conceiv'd Hopes that the
great <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i>, from his last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v_Book2" id="Page_v_Book2">[Pg v]</a></span>
Charge to his <i>Clergy</i>, will second you
in this Controversy; if so, there's no
doubt on't, but his Performance will be
commensurate to his State and Revenues.
Of his Zeal in the Controversy, he has
already given a notable Instance, when
he prosecuted the <i>Moderator</i>; and I
dare say, he'll vouchsafe us a more remarkable
Specimen of his Knowledge
in it, as soon as he can spare Time for't;
and then (Oh my Fears!) he'll pay me
off for my Objection against Christ's
Resurrection, which he would have
persuaded the Civil Magistrate to have
done for him.</p>

<p>But whether the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i>
seconds you or not, it's Time, <i>my Lord</i>,
to expect another Volume from you, in
Answer to Mr. <i>Scheme</i>, which, for all
the Reports that are spread of your intended
Silence, I hope soon to see publish'd.
What will the People say, if that
<i>Philisthin</i> goes off, giving you the last
Blow in the Controversy? Nothing less
than that he has gotten the better of the
Learned <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Lichfield</i>, and has refuted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi_Book2" id="Page_vi_Book2">[Pg vi]</a></span>
Christianity to the Conviction of
the Bishop himself, who would renounce
it too, but for the temporal Advantages
he enjoys by it.</p>

<p>Think, <i>my Lord</i>, on the Dishonour
of such Reflections, and resume Courage
against the Adversary. I look upon you
as a more sturdy Gladiator than for one
Cut on the Pate, to quit the Stage of
Battle. Tho' Mr. <i>Scheme</i> has unluckily
hit you on a soft Place, and weaken'd
your Intellectuals for a while; yet he is a
generous Combatant, and gives you
Time to recover your wonted Strength
of Reason. At him again then, <i>my Lord</i>,
and fear not, in your Turn, to give him
such a Home-Thrust, as will pierce his
unbelieving Heart.</p>

<p>And when your <i>Lordship</i> engages him
again from the <i>Press</i>, I hope you'll be
more explicite for Liberty of Debate.
Through godly Zeal for <i>Church</i>, you unhappily
made a Slip, in your <i>Dedication</i> to
the <i>King</i>, on the persecuting Side of the
Question, which had lik'd to have sully'd
the Glory of your whole Work. Such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii_Book2" id="Page_vii_Book2">[Pg vii]</a></span>
grand Philosopher, as you are, should
trust alone to the Goodness of your
Cause, and the Strength of your Reasonings,
in Defence of it: Such a potent
Champion for Christianity, as you are,
should disdain the Assistance of any, but
of God, to fight for you. The Use of
the Civil Sword on your Side, is not only
a Disparagement to your Parts, but a
Disgrace to our Religion.</p>

<p>I know not what your <i>Lordship</i> may
think on't, but the Prosecution of the
<i>Moderator</i> was, in the Judgment of others,
more than of my self, some Reproach to
you: Because of a few slender Animadversions,
I made on your renown'd Book,
some think I suffer'd a Prosecution, which
you, in Honour, should have discourag'd.
I am willing to acquit you as much as
may be; and would, if I could, impute
it to your Forgetfulness, rather than your
Malice, that you step'd not between me
and Danger.</p>

<p>Whether this Discourse will be acceptable
to your Lordship, is somewhat uncertain;
I am afraid it will be a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii_Book2" id="Page_viii_Book2">[Pg viii]</a></span>
disgustful to your nice and delicate Taste
in Theology, which relishes nothing better
than the plain and ordinary Food of the
Letter of <i>Christ</i>'s Miracles: But however,
you will readily interpret this <i>Dedication</i>
to your Honour, and if you should make
me a large present of Gold for it, I sincerely
assure your <i>Lordship</i>, it will be
more than I aim'd at; neither do I desire
any other Return for it, than to be endulg'd
the Liberty and Pleasure to pay
my customary Respects to your Writings;
and upon proper Occasions to testify
to the World, how much I am,</p>

</div>

<p> here publish another <i>Discourse</i>
on our Saviour's Miracles,
which I am not only
oblig'd to, by the Promise I
made in my former; but am encouraged to
it by the Reception which <i>that</i> met with.
If any of our <i>Clergy</i> were, and besides
them, few or none could be offended at
my former <i>Discourse</i>, they should have
printed their Exceptions to it, and, if possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_Book2" id="Page_2_Book2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
their Confutation of it, which might
perhaps have prevented me the giving
them any more Trouble of this Kind.</p>

<p>In my former <i>Discourse</i> I fairly declar'd,
that if the <i>Clergy</i> could disprove my Arguments
against the <i>Letter</i>, and for the <i>Spirit</i>
of the Miracles I there took to task, I would
not only desist from the Prosecution of my
Design, but own my self an impious <i>Infidel</i>
and <i>Blasphemer</i>, and deserving of the
worst Punishment: But since they are all
mute and silent, even in this Cause, which
in Honour and Interest they should have
spoken out to, they ought not to be angry,
if I proceed in it. I have given
them time enough to make a Reply, if
they had been of Ability to do it: What
must I think then upon their Silence? Nothing
less than that my Cause is impregnable,
and my Arguments and Authorities
in Defence of it irrefragable; and though
they don't professedly yield to the Force of
them; yet they have nothing to say in Abatement
of their Strength, or it had certainly
seen the Light before now.</p>

<p>I go on then in my undertaking to write
against the literal Story of our Saviour's
Miracles, and against the Use that is
commonly made of them to prove his divine
Authority and Messiahship: And this
I do, I solemnly again declare it, not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_Book2" id="Page_3_Book2">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the Service of Infidelity, but for the Honour
of the Holy Jesus, and to reduce the
<i>Clergy</i> to the good <i>old Way</i>, and the <i>only
Way</i> of proving his Messiahship, and that
is, by the allegorical Interpretation of the
Law and the Prophets. Therefore, without
any more Preamble, I resume again
the Consideration of the three Heads of
Discourse, before proposed to be treated
on to this Purpose. And they are,</p>

<p>I. To shew, That the Miracles of healing
all manner of Bodily Diseases, which
<i>Jesus</i> was justly fam'd for, are none of
the proper Miracles of the <i>Messiah</i>, neither
are they so much as a good Proof
of his divine Authority to found a Religion.</p>

<p>II. That the literal History of many of
the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>, as recorded by the
<i>Evangelists</i>, does imply Absurdities, Improbabilities,
and Incredibilities; consequently
they, either in whole or in part,
were never wrought, as they are commonly
believed now-a-days, but are only related
as prophetical and parabolical Narratives
of what would be mysteriously, and
more wonderfully done by him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_Book2" id="Page_4_Book2">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>III. To consider, what <i>Jesus</i> means,
when he appeals to his Miracles, as to a
Testimony and Witness of his divine Authority;
and to shew that he could not
properly and ultimately refer to those, he
then wrought in the <i>Flesh</i>, but to those
mystical ones, which he would do in the
<i>Spirit</i>, of which those wrought in the
Flesh are but mere Types and Shadows.</p>

<p>I have already spoken, what I then
thought sufficient to the first of these
Heads; and though I could now much enlarge
my Reasons, and multiply Authorities
upon it to the same Purpose; yet I
shall not do it; but only, by Way of
Introduction to my following <i>Discourse</i>,
say, that if it had been intended by our
Saviour, that any rational Argument for
his divine Authority and <i>Messiahship</i> should
be urged from his miraculous healing
Power; the Diseases which he cured,
would have been accurately described, and
his Manner of Operation so cautiously express'd,
as that we might have been sure
the Work was supernatural, and out of
the Power of Art and Nature to perform:
But the <i>Evangelists</i> have taken no such
Care in their Narrations of Christ's Miracles.
As for Instance, <i>Jesus</i> is supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5_Book2" id="Page_5_Book2">[Pg 5]</a></span>
often miraculously to cure <i>Lameness</i>; but
there is no Account of the nature and degree
of Lameness he cured; nor are we
certain, whether the Skill of a <i>Surgeon</i>,
or Nature it self, could not have done the
Work without his Help. If the <i>Evangelists</i>
had told us of Men, that wanted
one or both their Legs, (and such miserable
Objects of Christ's Power and Compassion,
were undoubtedly in those Days
as well as in ours) and how <i>Jesus</i> commanded
Nature to extend itself to the entire
Reparation of such Defects; here
would have been stupendous Miracles indeed,
which no Scepticism, nor Infidelity
itself could have cavill'd at; nor could I,
nor the Fathers themselves have told how
to allegorize, and make Parables of them.
But there is no <i>such</i> Miracle recorded of
Christ, nor any thing equal to it; so far
from it, that the best and greatest Miracles
of <i>Jesus</i>, which must confessedly be those
related at large, (for no Body can suppose
he did greater than those more particularly
specify'd) are liable to exception, being so
blindly, and lamely, and imperfectly reported,
as that, by Reasonings upon the
Letter of the Stories of them, they may
be dwindled away, and reduced to no
Wonders, which brings me to treat again
on the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6_Book2" id="Page_6_Book2">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>II. Second Head of my Discourse, and
that is, to shew, that the literal History
of the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>, as recorded in
the <i>Evangelists</i>, does imply Absurdities,
Improbabilities and Incredibilities; consequently
they, in whole or in part, were
never wrought, but are only related as parabolical
Narratives of what would be mysteriously,
and more wonderfully done by
him.</p>

<p>To this Purpose I, in my former Discourse,
took into Examination <i>three</i> of the
Miracles of Jesus, <i>viz.</i> those, of <i>his driving
the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple</i>;
Of <i>his exorcising the Devils out of
the Madmen, and sending them into the
Herd of Swine;</i> and <i>Of his Transfiguration
on the Mount</i>. How well I perform'd
on these Miracles which have been
admired for their literal Story, let others
judge and say.</p>

<p>I now will take into Consideration
three others of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, <i>viz.</i>
those, Of <i>his healing a Woman that was
afflicted with an Issue of Blood, twelve
Years</i>; Of <i>his curing the Woman that
labour'd under a Spirit of Infirmity, eighteen
Years</i>; and Of <i>his telling the</i> Samaritan
<i>Woman her Fortune of having had
five husbands, and living then in Adultery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7_Book2" id="Page_7_Book2">[Pg 7]</a></span>
with another Man</i>: Which are, all
three, reputedly most miraculous and admired
Stories. The two former, they say,
are Arguments of <i>Jesus</i>'s mighty Power;
and the latter, of his immense Knowledge:
But how little of certain Power and
Knowledge there is in any of them, according
to the Letter, will be seen in
the sequel of this Discourse. Infidels, I
dare say, if they had not wanted Liberty,
would e'er now have facetiously exposed
those Stories. If I snatch that Work out
of their Hands, our <i>Clergy</i> ought to be
glad, because what I do in it, is to the
Honour of the Holy <i>Jesus</i>, and to turn
those pretendedly miraculous Stories into
divine Mysteries.</p>

<p>In my former Discourse I gave my <i>Readers</i>
some Reason to expect, that in <i>this</i>
I would treat on some of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles,
which I there mentioned, <i>viz.</i> <i>On his turning
Water into Wine at a Marriage in</i>
Cana <i>of</i> Galilee; and <i>On his feeding of
Thousands with a few Loaves and Fishes
in the Wilderness</i>; and <i>On his Cure of
the Paralytick, for whom the Roof of
the House was broken up to let him down
into the Room where</i> Jesus <i>was</i>, &amp;c. And
I then really did design to speak to these
Miracles, but upon Consideration, finding
them most ludicrous Subjects according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8_Book2" id="Page_8_Book2">[Pg 8]</a></span>
to the Letter, I forbear it at present, having
no Inclination to put the <i>Clergy</i> quite
out of all Temper. If any should say,
this is Fear and Cowardice in me, I can't
help it: But, for all that, now I have the
<i>Clergy</i> in a tolerable good Humour for
Liberty, I'll endeavour to keep them in
it, and not disturb them by an hasty and
unnecessary Provocation of them. Who
knows not, that the <i>Clergy</i>, like an untamed
<i>Colt</i>, that I have a mind to ride, may
be apt to winch and kick, and may give
me a Fall before I come at the end of my
Journey, to the Disappointment of my
Readers? They shall therefore be gently
handled and stroak'd, till they are a little
more inur'd to the Bit and Saddle: And
for their Sakes will I postpone such Miracles
as are most obnoxious to Ridicule,
and at present chuse the aforesaid <i>three</i>,
that of almost any in the Gospel may be
most inoffensively treated on. I begin
then,</p>

<p>1. To speak to that Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
healing a <i>Woman diseased with an Issue
of Blood, twelve Years</i>. To please
our <i>Divines</i>, I will allow as much of the
Truth of the Letter of this Story, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9_Book2" id="Page_9_Book2">[Pg 9]</a></span>
can desire. The Fathers themselves, who
are for turning the whole History of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Life into Allegory and Mystery,
don't deny that a Woman was cured of an
<i>H&aelig;morrhage</i>, after the Manner that is
here described by the Evangelists. St. <i>Augustin</i>
says<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> of this Miracle, <i>that it
was done, as it is related</i>; and I have
a greater Veneration for his Authority,
than to gainsay it. But for all that,
<i>Infidels</i> may and will take into Examination
the nature of this Miracle, and if
possible make little or nothing of it. And
if I do this for them, it is not to do Service
to Infidelity, but to turn Mens Heads
to the mystical Use of it, for which it is
recorded.</p>

<p>As there is a particular Narration of
this Miracle, among the few others, that
are specified; so Reason should tell us,
that if the Letter of the Story of <i>Christ</i>'s
Miracles, as our <i>Divines</i> hold, is only to
be regarded, this is one of the greatest
that Jesus wrought, or it would not be
related by itself, but thrown into the
Lump of all manner of Diseases, which
He heal'd. And how then shall we
come to the Knowledge of the greatness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10_Book2" id="Page_10_Book2">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of this Miracle? Why, there are but two
Ways to it, and they are,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, By considering the nature of the
Disease, or the lamentable Condition of
the Patient before Cure. And</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, By considering the Manner or
Means by which the Cure was performed.</p>

<p>If one or both of these Considerations
don't manifest the Certainty of a Miracle,
<i>Infidels</i> may conclude there was none
in it.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, As to the nature of the Disease
of this Woman, we are much in the Dark
about it, and very uncertain of what Kind
and Degree it was. St. <i>Matthew</i> writing
of it, says the Woman was αιμορροουσα, that
is, <i>obnoxious to bleeding</i>; St. <i>Mark</i> and
St. <i>Luke</i> say of her, that ουσα εν ρευματε
αιματος, she was in an efflux or running of
Blood. But neither one nor the other of the
<i>Evangelists</i> signify of what Degree her
<i>H&aelig;morrhage</i> was, nor from what part of
her Body it proceeded, nor how often or
seldom she was addicted to it. It might be,
for ought we know, only a little bleeding
at the Nose, that now and then she was
subject to: Or it might be an obnoxiousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11_Book2" id="Page_11_Book2">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to an Evacuation of Blood by Siege
or Urine: Or it was, not improbably, of
the menstruous Kind. Any of these might
be the Case of this Woman for what's
written; and I don't find that any of our
<i>Divines</i> have determined of what sort it
was. But a great Miracle is wrought,
they think, in her Cure, without knowing
the Disease; which <i>Infidels</i> will say
is asserted at Random and without Reason,
in as much as it is necessary to know the
nature of the Distemper, or none truly
and properly can say, there was a great,
much less a miraculous Cure wrought.</p>

<p>But supposing this <i>H&aelig;morrhage</i> proceeded
from what Part of the Body our <i>Divines</i>
think fit; How will they make a
grievous Distemper of it in order to a Miracle?
The Woman subsisted too long under
her Issue of Blood, and bore it too
well, for any to make her Case very grievous.
<i>Beza</i><a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> will have it, that is was
a constant and incessant Effusion of Blood
that the Woman labour'd with. But this
could not be, nor was it possible, as I
suppose <i>Physicians</i> will agree, for Nature
to endure it so long, or the Woman to
live twelve Days, much less twelve Years
under it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12_Book2" id="Page_12_Book2">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>No more then, than some slight Indisposition
can reasonably and naturally be
made of this Woman's Distemper. And
it would be well, if Infidels would rest
here with their Objections against it. But
what if they should say, that this <i>H&aelig;morrhage</i>
was rather of Advantage to the
Health of the Patient, than of Danger to
her, and that the Woman was more <i>nice</i>
than <i>wise</i>, or she would never have sought
so much for Help and Cure of it? Some
<i>H&aelig;morrhages</i> are better kept open than
stop'd and dry'd up; and if <i>Infidels</i> should
say, that <i>this</i> was a Preservative of the
Life of the Woman, like an <i>Issue</i>, at which
Nature discharges itself of bad Humours,
Who can contradict them? Nay, if they
should say that <i>Jesus</i>'s Cure of this Woman's
<i>H&aelig;morrhage</i> was a Precipitation of
her Death, for she died some time after it,
rather than a Prolongation of her Life,
for she lived twelve Years under it, and
was of good Strength, when she applied
to our Saviour for Cure, or she could never
have born the press of the People to
come at him; Who can gainsay them?
It is true she was very sollicitous for a
Cure, and uneasy under her Distemper,
or she would never have spent all she had
on <i>Physicians</i>; which is a Sign, some
may say, that her Disease was grievous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13_Book2" id="Page_13_Book2">[Pg 13]</a></span>
irksome, and dangerous, as well as incurable
by Art. But <i>Infidels</i> will say,
not so; for there are some slight cutaneous
Distempers, sometimes issuing with
a little purulent and bloody Matter,
that nice Women will be at a great
Expence for Relief, and are always tampering,
and often advising about them,
though to no Purpose: And if they
should say that this was the worth of the
Case of this Woman, Who can disprove
it?</p>

<p>In short then here is an uncertain Distemper
both in Nature and Degree; how
then can there be any Certainty of a Miracle
in the Cure of it? Mr. <i>Moore</i>, the
<i>Apothecary</i>, accurately describes the Diseases
he pretends to have cured; and he
is in the right on't so to do, or he could
not recommend his Art, and aggrandize
his own Fame. So the Bodily Disease of
this Woman should have been clearly and
fully represented to our Understanding, or
we can form no Conception of Christ's
Power in the Cure of it. And I can't
but think that the <i>Evangelists</i>, especially
St. <i>Luke</i> the <i>Physician</i>, had made a better
Story of this Woman's Case, if Christ's
Authority and Power had been to be urg'd
from the Letter of it. It's enough to make
us think, Christ cured no extraordinary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14_Book2" id="Page_14_Book2">[Pg 14]</a></span>
grievous Maladies, or the <i>Evangelists</i>
would never have instanced in this, that
so much Exception is to be made to. As
then, reasonably speaking, there was no
extraordinary Disease in this Woman cured,
and consequently no great Miracle wrought;
so let us now,</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Consider the Manner of the
Cure, and whether any Miracle is to be
thence proved. <i>The Woman said within
her self,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> that if she could but touch
the Hem of Jesus's Garment, she should
be made whole.</i> And I can't but commend
her, at this distance of Time, for
the Power of her Faith, Persuasion, or
Imagination in the Case, which was a
good Preparative for Relief, and without
which, it's certain, she had continued
under her Disease. The Power of Imagination,
it's well known, will work Wonders,
see Visions, produce Monsters, and
heal Diseases, as Experience and History
doth testify. There being many Instances
to be given of Cures performed
by frivolous Applications, Charms, and
Spells, which are unaccountable any other
Way, than by the Imagination of the Patient.
Against the Reason and Judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15_Book2" id="Page_15_Book2">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of a <i>Physician</i>, sometimes the diseased
will take his own Medicines and Benefit.
And I don't doubt, but Stories
may be told of Cures wrought, the Imagination
of the Patient helping, by as mean
a Trifle, as the Touch of Christ's Garments,
and no Miracle talk'd on for it.
Even in the ordinary, natural, and rational
Use of Physick, it is requisite, that
the Patient have a good Opinion of his
<i>Physician</i> and of his Medicines. A good
Heart in the Sick, tends not only to his
Support, but helps the Operation of Prescriptions.
As despair and dejection of
Mind sometimes kills, where otherwise
reasonably speaking, proper Medicines
would cure; so a good Conceit in the Patient
at other times, whether the Medicines
be pertinent or not, is almost all
in all. And if Infidels should say that
this was the Case of this Woman in the
Gospel; if they should say as St. <i>John of
Jerusalem</i><a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> did, <i>that her own Imagination
cured herself</i>; and should urge the
Probability of it, because <i>Jesus</i> could do
no Cures and<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Miracles against Unbelief,
Who can help it? In this Case our
<i>Divines</i> must prove, that this Woman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16_Book2" id="Page_16_Book2">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<i>H&aelig;morrhage</i> was of that kind, that no
Faith nor Fancy in herself could help her
without the Divine Power; but this is impossible
for them to do, unless there had been
a more certain Description of her Disease,
than the <i>Evangelists</i> have given of it.</p>

<p>Our <i>Divines</i> will indeed tell us, what
I believe, that it was the Divine Power
co-operating with the Faith and Imagination
of the Woman that cured her; because
Jesus says <i>that Virtue had gone out
of him</i> to the healing of her: And I wish
<i>Infidels</i> would acquiesce here, and not
say, that <i>Jesus</i>'s Virtue hung very loose
on him, or the Woman's Faith, like a Fascination,
could never have extracted it against
his Will and Knowledge: But what
if they should say, that <i>Jesus</i>, being secretly
appriz'd of the Woman's Faith,
and Touch of him, took the Hint; and
to comfort and confirm her in her Conceit,
and to help the Cure forward, said, <i>Virtue
was gone out of him?</i> This would
be an untoward Suggestion, which if Infidels
should make, our Divines must look
for a Reply to it.</p>

<p>It is said of the <i>Pope</i>, when he was
last at <i>Benevento</i>, that he wrought three
Miracles, which our Protestant <i>Clergy</i>, I
dare say, believe nothing at all of. But,
for all that, it is not improbable, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17_Book2" id="Page_17_Book2">[Pg 17]</a></span>
some diseased People, considering their
superstitious Veneration for the <i>Pope</i>, and
their Opinion of the Sanctity of the <i>Present</i>,
might be persuaded of his Gift of Miracles,
and desirous of his Exercise of it; and if
they fancyfully or actually received Benefit
by his Touch, I don't wonder, without
a Miracle. And what if we had been told
of the <i>Popes</i> curing an <i>H&aelig;morrhage</i> like
this before us? What would <i>Protestants</i>
have said to it? Why, "that a foolish,
credulous, and superstitious Woman had
fancy'd herself cured of some slight Indisposition;
and the crafty <i>Pope</i> and his
Adherents, aspiring after popular Applause,
magnified the presumed Cure
into a Miracle. If they would have us
<i>Protestants</i> to believe the Miracle, they
should have given us an exacter Description
of her Disease, and then we could
better have judg'd of it". The Application
of such a supposed Story of a Miracle
wrought by the <i>Pope</i>, is easy; and
if <i>Infidels</i>, <i>Jews</i>, and <i>Mahometans</i> who
have no better Opinion of <i>Jesus</i>, than we
have of the <i>Pope</i>, should make it, there's
no Help for it.</p>

<p>And thus have I made my Descants on
this supposed Miracle before us and argued,
as much as I could, against the Miraculousness
of it, both from the <i>Nature</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18_Book2" id="Page_18_Book2">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of the Disease, and the <i>Manner</i> of the
Cure of it. Whether any one shall think
I have said any thing to the Purpose or
not, is all one to me. My Design in what
I have done, is not to do Service to Infidelity,
but, upon the Command and Encouragement
of the Fathers, to turn Mens
Thoughts to the mystical Meaning of the
said Miracle, which I come now to give
an Account of.</p>

<p>None of the Fathers (excepting St.
<i>Chrysostom</i><a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, who writes here more like
an <i>Orator</i> than a <i>Physician</i>) ever trouble
themselves, when they speak of this Miracle,
about the Nature of the Disease,
literally, in this Woman, or the greatness
of the Cure of it; but alone bend their
Studies to the mystical Interpretation, for
the sake of which, this Evangelical Story
was written, and originally transacted.</p>

<p>Accordingly, they tell us that this Woman
is a Type<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> of the Church of the
<i>Gentiles</i> in after Times. And as to her
<i>H&aelig;morrhage</i> or <i>Issue of Blood</i>, they understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19_Book2" id="Page_19_Book2">[Pg 19]</a></span>
it of the<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Impurity and Corruption
of the Church by ill Principles
and bad Morals, that the would <i>flow with</i>.
Some of the Fathers, as<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> <i>Gregory
Nazianzen</i>, and<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> <i>Eusebius Gallicanus</i>,
will have the <i>Issue of Blood</i> to be a
Type of the scarlet Sin of Blood-guiltiness
in the Church: If so, we must understand
it of the Effusion of Christian
Blood by War and Persecution.</p>

<p>The <i>twelve Years</i> of the Woman's Affliction
with her <i>H&aelig;morrhage</i> is a typical
Number of the Church's impure State for
above <i>twelve Hundred Years</i>. And
whether some of the primitive Church
did not, by the said <i>twelve Years</i> of the
Woman, understand <i>twelve Ages</i>, I appeal
to<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> <i>Iren&aelig;us</i>, to whom I refer my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20_Book2" id="Page_20_Book2">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Readers, Accordingly this typify'd Woman
of the Church, should be the same
with the Woman<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> in the Wilderness,
that, as St. <i>John</i> says, was twelve Hundred
and sixty Days or Years there sustained;
and by whom many Protestants, as
well as the Fathers, understand the Church
universal. When the said twelve Hundred
and sixty Days or Years of the Church's
being in the Wilderness, did commence
or will end, is none of my Business to
enquire or ascertain. But as this Woman
in the Gospel is said after <i>twelve Years</i>
Affliction, to be cured of her Disease by
<i>Jesus</i>; so it is the Opinion of the Fathers,
that the Church universal, after <i>twelve
Hundred Years</i> of her Wilderness State,
will be purified and sanctified by the Gifts
of the Spirit of Christ, and enter upon a
more holy, peaceable, and happy Condition,
absolutely freed from her <i>Issue of Blood</i>,
which, through Persecution and War, she
has for many Ages labour'd under. It is
not my Concern to collect all the Authorities
of the Fathers to this Purpose; but
only say, that if at the End of twelve Hundred
and sixty Days or Years, the Church,
like the Woman, be not cur'd of her <i>H&aelig;morrhage</i>
and mystical <i>Wounds</i> and <i>Sores</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21_Book2" id="Page_21_Book2">[Pg 21]</a></span>
if her present impure and unsound State
be not chang'd into an holy, healthy, and
peaceable one; many good <i>Protestants</i>, as
well as the Fathers, are mistaken, and
abundance of Prophecies of the Old and
New Testament, that have been hereunto
urged, will lose their Credit.</p>

<p>But who are meant by the <i>Physicians</i>
of the Woman, that have had the mystical
<i>H&aelig;morrhage</i> and Diseases of the
Church Under Cure all this while? Who
should, but pretended Ministers, of the
Gospel? Ministers of the Gospel are not
only by the Fathers call'd metaphorically<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
spiritual <i>Physicians</i>; but our <i>Divines</i>
and Preachers of all Denominations
like the Metaphor, and think themselves
able <i>Physicians</i> at the Diseases of the
Church, which they are forward to prescribe
and apply Medicines to, whenever,
in their Opinion, she stands in need of
them. Whether our <i>Divines</i> like to be
accounted the <i>Physicians</i> of the Text before
us, I much question; but it is certain
that<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> <i>Eusebius Gallicanus</i> expressly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22_Book2" id="Page_22_Book2">[Pg 22]</a></span>
says, that our <i>Divines</i> and pretended Philosophers
are meant by them; and venerable
<i>Bede</i><a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> upon the Place is of the
same Mind too.</p>

<p>The Woman of the Gospel is said<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> to
<i>suffer many Things of many Physicians,
and was nothing better'd, but rather
grew worse</i>; that is, she grew worse not
in time only, but through the Use of her
<i>Physicians</i>, who were her<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Tormentors.
So the Diseases of the Church in
time have increased, for all the Use she
has made of her spiritual Physicians, <i>the
Clergy</i>. In every Age has the Church
been degenerating in Morals and Principles,
as any one knows, that is able to make an
Estimate of Religion in times past; and
all along have her ecclesiastical <i>Quack
Doctors</i> contributed to her ill State of
Health. As many Physicians with their
different Applications tormented the poor
Woman; so our many <i>Empericks</i> in Theology
with their different <i>Schemes</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23_Book2" id="Page_23_Book2">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Church Government and various <i>Systems</i> of
Divinity, like so many Prescriptions for
Cure, have increased the Divisions, widen'd
the Wounds, and inflamed the Sores
of the Church. And if the Woman's
<i>Issue of Blood</i> be, according to the Fathers,
a particular Type of the Blood of the
Church, that is shed in Persecution and
War; our Theological Pretenders to Physick,
have been so far from providing and
prescribing a good <i>Stiptic</i> in this Case
that they have been the Occasion of the Effusion
of much Christian Blood; there having
been many a War and Persecution, that
these <i>Incision</i> Doctors, who should be all
<i>Balsam</i>, have been the Cause of.</p>

<p>The Woman <i>spent all her Living</i>, all
her yearly Income, upon her Physicians,
and as it seems to a bad Purpose; so very
great and large Revenues of the Church,
are expended on her ecclesiastical Doctors
in spiritual Physick: And to what End
and Purpose? Why, to open and widen
the bleeding Wounds of the Church,
which they should heal and salve up. It
is now about <i>twelve Hundred Years</i>, like
the <i>twelve Years</i> of the Woman, that the
<i>Clergy</i>, our Practitioners in Theological
Physick, have received of the Church
vast Fees, Stipends and Gratuities (for before
that time her <i>Doctors</i> prescrib'd freely)
to take care of her Health and Welfare;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24_Book2" id="Page_24_Book2">[Pg 24]</a></span>
but unless God provide in due time
a Medicine of his own, she is likely to
continue in a diseased and sorrowful Condition
for all them.</p>

<p>One would think that the Woman of
the Gospel might have had more Wit than
to lay out all she was worth upon <i>Physicians</i>
to no good Purpose; one would
think that after some Experience of their
Insufficiency to cure her, she might have
forborn seeing them, and reserved the Remains
of her Estate for better Uses: So
the Fees and Revenues of the Church, after
due Experience of the Inability of her
spiritual Doctors to heal her Sores, might
have been in my Opinion better employ'd,
and the Church of Christ more out of
Danger of Wounds and Sickness, by Sin
and Error. Certain it is, that many an <i>Issue
of Blood</i>, through Persecution and War,
had been prevented; if such barbarous
and blood thirsty Doctors of Ecclesiastical
Physick, had never been so fee'd and hired
to take care of the Welfare of the Church,
which, for all their Spiritual Medicines,
will continue in a languishing Condition,
till heal'd by the Virtue and Graces
of the Spirit of Christ in his foresaid appointed
Time.</p>

<p>So much then to the mystical Interpretation
of the Story of the Cure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25_Book2" id="Page_25_Book2">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<i>Issue of Blood</i> in this Woman. Every minute
Circumstance of it is thus to be allegorized,
if need was. Whether the
<i>Clergy</i> will like this parabolical Explication
of it, I neither know nor care. They
have their Liberty with <i>Atheists</i> and <i>Infidels</i>
to believe as little of it as they think
fit; and I hope they'll give me leave with
the Fathers of the Church to believe as
much of it as I please. But whether they
approve of this allegorical Interpretation
of this supposed Miracle or not; they must
own, that if the Church, after the foresaid
<i>twelve Ages</i>, should be purified and
sanctified; if her Errors and Corruptions,
of which the Woman's <i>Uncleanness</i> is a
Type, should be heal'd; if War and Persecution,
typified by her <i>Issue of Blood</i>,
should then entirely cease; if all Christians
should then be united in Principle,
Heart and Affection, and made to walk in
a peaceable and quiet State, as the Woman
was<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> <i>bid to go in Peace</i>; if the
Church should then <i>come behind</i> Jesus
(which<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> is a Figure of future Time)
and rightly touch by Faith, and apprehend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26_Book2" id="Page_26_Book2">[Pg 26]</a></span>
his<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Garments or Words of Prophecy,
about which Christians have hitherto
been <i>pressing</i> and urgent; and
if the Gifts of the Spirit, like <i>Virtue
on the Woman</i>, should then be poured
forth upon the Church to the absolute
Cure of her present Diseases, we must, I
say, allow the Story of this Woman to
be an admirable Emblem and typical Representation;
and the Accomplishment of
it most miraculous and stupendous; and
not only an indisputable Proof of the
Power and Presence of Christ with his
Church, but a Demonstration of his <i>Messiahship</i>,
in as much as an almost infinite
Number of Prophecies of the Old
Testament, will thereupon receive that Accomplishment,
which hitherto, by no shadow
of Reason, can be pretended to.</p>

<p>After such a mystical Healing of the
<i>H&aelig;morrhage</i> of the Church, there's no
doubt on't, but the Story of this Woman
in the Gospel will be allow'd to be typical
and emblematical. In the mean time, without
making a Parable of the Story of her,
I assert, there is little or nothing of a
Miracle to be made of her Cure, unless
we were at a greater Certainty about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27_Book2" id="Page_27_Book2">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Nature of her Disease, and the Manner,
rationally speaking, of <i>Jesus</i>'s healing of
it. And so I pass to the Consideration
of</p>

<p>2. Another Story of a miraculous Cure
perform'd by <i>Jesus</i> on another Woman,
and that is on her, who<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> <i>had a Spirit
of Infirmity, eighteen Years, and was
bow'd together, and could in no wise
lift up herself&mdash;&mdash;being bound of Satan</i>,
&amp;c. This too, as I suppose, is with
our <i>Divines</i> a great Miracle, and one
of the greatest that <i>Jesus</i> wrought,
or it had not been specify'd, but cast
indiscriminately into the Number of all
manner of Diseases, which he heal'd.
And for the sake of the Letter, and to
please our <i>Divines</i>, whom I would not
offend wilfully, I will allow, that <i>Jesus</i>
might lay his Hands on, and speak comfortably
to such a drooping, stooping, and
vaporous Woman, full of Fancies of the
<i>Devil</i>'s Temptation and Power over her;
and she might thereupon recover, and be
afterwards of a more cheerful Heart, and
erect Countenance, freed from the whimsical
Imagination of being <i>Satan-ridden</i>:
And what of all that? Where's the Miracle?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28_Book2" id="Page_28_Book2">[Pg 28]</a></span>
If the Story of such a Miracle had
been related of any <i>Impostor</i> in Religion,
of an <i>Arch-Heretick</i>, or <i>Popish Exorcist</i>,
our <i>Divines</i> would have flouted at it;
they would have told us, there was nothing
supernatural and uncommon in the
Event, nor any thing at all to be wonder'd
at in it. Taking the <i>Devil</i> out of
this Story, and there's no more in it, than
what's common for a simple, melancholy,
and drooping Woman, to be chear'd and
elated upon the comfortable Advice and
Admonition of a reputedly wise and good
Man. And the putting the <i>Devil</i> into
the Story, in another Case, our <i>Divines</i>
would have said was only the Fancy of
the Woman, or the Device of the <i>Miracle-Monger</i>,
to magnify his own Art and
Power. And if <i>Infidels</i>, <i>Jews</i>, and <i>Mahometans</i>,
should say so of this Story of
<i>Jesus</i>, they would be no more unreasonable
in their Conjectures and Solutions of
this Miracle, than we should have been in
another and parallel Case.</p>

<p>The <i>Pope</i>, when last at <i>Benevento</i>, is
said to have exorciz'd a <i>D&aelig;mon</i> out of a
young Maid, which our <i>Divines</i> no more
believe than <i>Infidels</i> do. But it is not at
all impossible or improbable, that a young
Woman might be troubled with Vapours,
and go droopingly upon it, whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29_Book2" id="Page_29_Book2">[Pg 29]</a></span>
holy Father, of whose Prayers and Sanctity
she had a good Opinion, might relieve
with his Talk, and give another Turn
to her Thoughts and Temper: And if she
fancy'd herself before possess'd with a <i>D&aelig;mon</i>,
or rather, if the <i>Pope</i>'s Partizans persuaded
her so, it's not unlikely to make a
Miracle on't. Just so may <i>Infidels</i>, with
their Descants on this Miracle before us,
reduce and lessen it: And what must we
Believers do then? Why, we must find
out a Way to ascertain the Truth and
Greatness of the Miracle, or give it up.
We must determine certainly what was the
Woman's Distemper, and how the Cure
of it by ordinary Means was impossible, or
make no more Words about it.</p>

<p>And how can we come at the Knowledge
of this Woman's Disease, but by
the original Words of the <i>Evangelist</i>.
St. <i>Luke</i> says, she was one πνευμα εχουσα
ασθενειας, <i>that had a Spirit of Weakness</i>,
that is, was poor-Spirited and pusilanimous;
and if she was συγκυπτουσα, <i>bow'd
down</i> upon't, its no more than might be
expected of a disconsolate, melancholy and
dejected Person. Here then is the Disease
of the Woman: If it had been worse, St.
<i>Luke</i>, the Physician, if he was of Sufficiency
in his Art, should better have express'd
himself; so as to give us another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30_Book2" id="Page_30_Book2">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Conception of it. And if <i>Satan</i> had not
been brought into the Tale, whom it is
easy, by reasoning as above, to exorcise
out of it, here is a no more grievous Distemper,
than what upon the comfortable
Exhortations of a wise Man may be cured.
And do what our Divines can, they can
make literally no more of this Story.</p>

<p>It is said, that for <i>eighteen Years</i> the
Woman labour'd under this Disease. And
she might be <i>hippish</i> and <i>drooping</i> for a
longer time, and be no less easily at last
cured. It's pity the <i>Evangelist</i> had not
told us how old this Woman was, when
the Distemper first seiz'd her; then we
could have made better Conjectures about
the Nature and Cure of it. If there was
any room to suppose, either from the
Words of Scripture or extra-scriptural History,
that she was about <i>fifty</i> or <i>sixty</i>,
when she first began to droop and the
<i>Devil</i> got upon her Back; here had been
Scope for a most stupendous Miracle; and
our <i>Divines</i> might have asserted, what
no Body could have contradicted, that <i>Jesus</i>
had made an old Woman, who was
<i>bow'd down</i>, not only under the Weight
of <i>Satan</i>, but under the Burthen of seventy
or eighty Years, young again; and
had restored her to the Health, Vigor,
and Beauty of one of fifteen. Here would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31_Book2" id="Page_31_Book2">[Pg 31]</a></span>
have been a mighty Miracle indeed. And
I don't doubt, but our <i>Divines</i> would
willingly get into such a Notion of this
Miracle, and would heartily espouse it,
but for the Offence they must needs give
to decrepid old Women, who may be out
of Conceit with themselves upon it, as if
they carried the <i>Devil</i> on their Shoulders,
as the Cause of their Decripedness and
Incurvity. And such an Offence would be
of ill Consequence.</p>

<p>Reasonably then speaking, there was
not much in the Disease and Cure of this
Woman. Excepting that Part, which <i>Satan</i>
bears, in the Story, there is nothing
wonderful in it. And supposing <i>Jesus</i>
might exorcise the <i>Devil</i> out of this Woman,
or dismount him from off her
Shoulders; yet even this makes nothing
for his Divine Power and Authority, in
as much as many <i>Exorcists</i> among the
<i>Jews</i> and even among <i>Papists</i>, if Protestants
had not more Wit than to believe it,
could do as much. And after all, I don't
believe the <i>Evangelist</i> intended, that our
Saviour should be had in Admiration for
the Letter of this Miracle, or St. <i>Luke</i>
would accurately have described the Disease,
so as to put it out of the Power of
Nature and Art to heal it, and of the
Wit of <i>Infidels</i> to cavil at the miraculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32_Book2" id="Page_32_Book2">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Cure of it. Neither do I find that the
Fathers of the Church ever trouble themselves
about the Letter of this Story,
which is some Argument, that no great
Heed is to be given to it; but are only curious
about the Mystery, for which this
Miracle was related, and which I come
now to give an Account of.</p>

<p>As the Fathers said of the Woman with
her <i>Issue of Blood</i>, that she was a Type
of the Church; so they say of this Woman
with her <i>Spirit of Infirmity</i>, that
she is a<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Figure of the Church too.</p>

<p>As the Woman was <i>bow'd together</i>; so
the Church, as the Fathers do interpret,
may be said to be<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> <i>bow'd down</i> to the
Earth, when she is <i>prone</i> and <i>bent</i> to, and
<i>intent on</i> the literal or earthly Interpretations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33_Book2" id="Page_33_Book2">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of the Scriptures; and <i>can in no
wise lift up her self</i>, like the Woman,
<i>that is</i>, can't raise her Thoughts to the
Contemplation of the c&aelig;lestial, spiritual,
and sublime Sense of them. Hence we
see the Propriety of the Name of the Woman's
Disease, call'd πνευμα ασθενειας, a
<i>Spirit of Weakness</i>, which is not properly
significative of any bodily Distemper, but
succinctly is very expressive of the Church's
<i>Weakness</i> at the <i>Spirit</i> of Prophecy, which
at this Day she labours under.</p>

<p>As it was <i>eighteen Years</i> that the Woman
was griev'd with her <i>Spirit of Infirmity</i>,
for so long had her Distemper been
growing on her; so it is almost eighteen
(hundred) Years, or the eighteenth Century
of Years, that this <i>Infirmity</i> of the
Church at the <i>Spirit</i> of Prophecy has been
coming on her: And she is now so <i>bent</i>
to the Earth of the Letter, that nothing
less than the Hand and Power of Jesus,
that erected the Woman, can raise her to
mystical, divine, and sublime Contemplations
on the Law and Prophets. St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
will have these <i>eighteen
Years</i> of the Woman's <i>Infirmity</i>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34_Book2" id="Page_34_Book2">[Pg 34]</a></span>
she is a Type of the Church, to be synchronical
with the<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> <i>three Years</i> of the
Fig-Tree's Unfruitfulness. I don't rightly
apprehend his mystical Arithmetic. But this
is certain, upon the Authority of the Fathers,
that those two Numbers, with the
<i>twelve Years</i> of the Woman's <i>Issue of Blood</i>,
are all conterminous and will end together:
Consequently at the same time, that
the Woman of the Church will be cured
of her <i>Issue of Blood</i>, she will be heal'd
of her <i>Infirmity</i> at the <i>Spirit</i> of Prophecy;
<i>that is</i>, at the Conclusion of certain
grand Periods of Time she will enter upon
a blessed State of <i>Peace</i> and <i>Vision</i>;
which is the concurrent Doctrine of the
Fathers, as any one may discern, that has
dip'd into them, and is a good Confirmation
of our present Exposition, and mystical
Application of the miraculous Story
before us.</p>

<p>St. <i>Luke</i> says, that the Woman could
not lift up herself εις το παντελες, <i>v.</i> 11. which,
without animadverting on our <i>English</i>
Translation, should be rendered, <i>until all
was perfected</i>, or until the <i>Perfection of
Time</i>, which, the Apostle<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and the
Fathers agree, is the Time for the Church
to be cured of her <i>Weakness</i>, and to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35_Book2" id="Page_35_Book2">[Pg 35]</a></span>
endu'd with <i>Power</i> at the Spirit of Prophecy.</p>

<p>As the Woman was heal'd by <i>Jesus</i> on
the Sabbath-Day; so the Church, upon
the ample Authorities of the Fathers,
which Men of Reading will excuse me
the Production of, is certainly to be heal'd
of her <i>spiritual Infirmity</i>, at the Understanding
of Prophecy against the mystical
and<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> grand Sabbath, which, according
to the Fathers, commences at the Expiration
of her eighteen (hundred) Years
<i>Weakness</i>.</p>

<p>But the <i>Ruler of the Synagogue is said
to be moved with Indignation, v.</i> 14.
at this charitable Work of <i>Jesus</i>, in healing
of the Woman, because it was done
on the Sabbath-Day; which in my Opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36_Book2" id="Page_36_Book2">[Pg 36]</a></span>
can't be literally true: Though I
am willing enough, to please our <i>Divines</i>,
to allow as much as may be of the
Letter of this Story, yet I except against
this Part of it. <i>Origen</i> says, there are
some things of the Gospel related as Facts,
which were not done; and I believe this
of the Ruler of the Synagogue to be one
of them. Human Nature, I think, is not
capable of such base and unnatural Resentment.
Works of Necessity, and requisite
Offices of Kindness and Charity to
Man and Beast, were allow'd by the Law,
and practised by the <i>Jews</i> on the Sabbath:
And the Cure of this Woman, though on
the Sabbath-Day, was such an Act of Beneficence
and Compassion in the Holy <i>Jesus</i>,
that I can't but think <i>bad</i>, as well as <i>good</i>
Men, would rather glorify God, that had
given such Power unto Man, than find
fault with it. But in the Mystery of this
Part of the Story, there is clear Sense
and Truth. Who then is this <i>Archisynagogus</i>,
or Ruler of the Synagogue, that
will be full of Indignation at the healing
of the Church of her foresaid <i>Infirmity</i>
at the <i>Spirit</i> of Prophecy? <i>Origen</i>
says that the<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> right Interpretation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37_Book2" id="Page_37_Book2">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the Names of Persons and Places in Scripture
is of good Use to the mystical Application.
Accordingly <i>Archisynagogus</i>
does signify the <i>Chiefs of our Congregations</i>:
And who should they be then but
the Clergy? And if this ben't enough
to fix this Name and Character upon them,
then let <i>Theophanes Cerameus</i> speak here,
who says, that the <i>Archisynagogus</i>, is a<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
<i>Type of all Priests</i>, who will be
against the foresaid miraculous healing of
the Church. And why will the <i>Clergy</i>
be mov'd 'with Indignation at the curing
the Church of her <i>Infirm</i>, and restoring
her to a <i>sound</i> Spirit of Prophecy? Because
as St. <i>Augustin</i> says,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> they are not
only <i>bow'd down</i> to the Letter themselves;
but because this <i>Infirmity</i> of the Church
will be a Reproach to them, in as much
as it is a Proof of their Apostacy and Insufficiency
at Prophecy; and the Cure of
it will be attended with such Consequences,
as affect their Reputation and Interests.
Who can question but the <i>Clergy</i>, who
are the <i>Archisynagogus</i> of the Text, and
who are for the Church's <i>bending</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38_Book2" id="Page_38_Book2">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<i>stooping</i> to the low Sense of the Letter of
the Scripture, will be averse to her being
rais'd, <i>lifted up</i>, and erected to the Contemplation
of the sublime, anagogical,
and heavenly Sense of it? Such an Healing
and Erection of the Church will vex
them at the Heart, as it will bring <i>Shame</i>
and loss of Interest along with it; and
they will undoubtedly be <i>Adversaries</i> to
this good Work of <i>Christ</i>, which, upon
the Testimony of all Antiquity, is to be
done on or against the Evangelical and
great Sabbath.</p>

<p>Our Saviour is supposed to reprove the
<i>Ruler</i> of the <i>Synagogue</i>, for his <i>Indignation</i>
at the Cure of the Woman on the
Sabbath-Day, saying, <i>v.</i> 15. <i>Thou Hypocrite,
doth not each one of you on the
Sabbath loose his Ox or his Ass from the
Stall, and lead him away to Watering?
And ought not this Woman to be loos'd
from this Bond on the Sabbath-Day?</i>
There is Force in this Argument according
to the Letter: And the <i>Ruler</i> of the <i>Synagogue</i>,
and other <i>Jesus</i>'s Adversaries
hereupon, might well be <i>asham'd</i> for finding
Fault with such a merciful and beneficent
Work done on the <i>Sabbath</i>; when
they themselves did Works on the <i>Sabbath</i>
of much less Consequence. But to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39_Book2" id="Page_39_Book2">[Pg 39]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
the Mystery. What may be said to
our Ministers of the Letter, of whom the
<i>Archisynagogus</i> is a Type, for their Averseness
to the healing of the Church in
like manner? Why, that they are <i>Hypocrites</i>,
that is, superficial Criticks on
the Scriptures, and don't consider that <i>the
Law is spiritual</i>, and how against the
Evangelical Sabbath every Man is to be
released from his Bondage and Servility to
irrational Principles (for which he has been
like an <i>Ox</i> and an <i>Ass</i>) and to be conducted
to drink of the Waters of Divine Wisdom:
For this grand Sabbath will be a Day of
absolute Liberty, perfect <i>Rest</i>, immense
Knowledge, real Vision and Contemplation
on God and his Providence, as the
antient <i>Jews</i> and Fathers so copiously declare,
that they who are ignorant herein,
may be <i>ashamed</i>; consequently they
might know, that the Church is to be
cured of her <i>Spirit of Weakness</i> at Prophecy
on that Day.</p>

<p>But <i>Satan</i> is said to have <i>v.</i> 16. <i>bound</i>,
and, as is supposed, <i>bow'd down</i> this Woman;
the literal Truth of which I much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40_Book2" id="Page_40_Book2">[Pg 40]</a></span>
question: But how then has <i>Satan bound
and bow'd down</i> the Church? This, seemingly,
is the great Difficulty in the mystical
Application of this Story, and must be
the great Curiosity of my Readers to know
how I will account for it. If the Fathers
don't help me out at this dead Lift, and
that clearly and intelligibly too, I shall
abate of my Veneration for them. If they
don't tell me, and make me to apprehend,
what this <i>Satan</i> is, that for many Ages
has <i>bound</i> and oppress'd the Church after
the supposed Manner of the typical Woman,
I had better have held my Peace,
and said nothing to this parabolical Miracle.</p>

<p>The Writings of the <i>Evangelists</i> so abound
with Stories of <i>Satan</i>, <i>Belzebub</i>,
the <i>Devil</i>, and of greater and less Number
of <i>Devils</i>, and of <i>D&aelig;mons</i> and of
<i>unclean Spirits</i>, more than any Histories
before, as one would think, if these Stories
were literally to be understood, that
was the Age in which Christ came, that
<i>Hell</i> first broke loose, and then primarily
infested Mankind; and that upon the
Destruction of <i>Jud&aelig;a</i> and Propagation
of the Gospel, the <i>Devils</i> accompanied
the <i>Jews</i> in their Dispersion, or the <i>Apostles</i>
in their Travels, and have been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41_Book2" id="Page_41_Book2">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Tempters, Seducers, and Tormentors of
other Nations ever since.</p>

<p><i>Arnobius</i><a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> says, <i>That before Christ,
Devils were things unknown to the World</i>;
by which <i>Arnobius</i> must mean, either that
they were hardly talk'd of before, or that
their Nature was not understood, till
Christ inform'd us of it. In both these
Senses, I believe, <i>Arnobius</i> may be taken,
<i>viz.</i> that there was not only little Talk
of <i>Satan</i> and the <i>Devil</i>, but less of his
Nature apprehended, before <i>Christ</i> by his
Parables and parabolical Miracles, rightly
interpreted, instructed us in it. And if
after Ages have departed from the true and
original Doctrine of <i>Devils</i>, making a
literal Story of that, which is only mystical
and cabalistical; and have formed to
themselves <i>Ideas</i> of hideous and horrible
Fiends, <i>Mormos</i> and <i>Hobgoblins</i>, it shall
not disturb me.</p>

<p>As to the Place and State of <i>Hell</i>, many
are the Notions of <i>Divines</i> of several
Ages past, as well as of the present. I
shall not recount them all here, much less
refute any of them. But there is an antient,
rational, and cabalistical Notion of
Hell, which I have learned of the Fathers,
who signify, that the babylonish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42_Book2" id="Page_42_Book2">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and bewilder'd State of Christ's Church
may be call'd <i>Hell</i>, because, as the
Word αδης does import, it is a State <i>without
Vision</i>. Hence <i>Origen</i> says,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> that
whoever can form to himself an <i>Idea</i> of
the Church in time to come, when she
will be dignified with the Title of the
<i>New Jerusalem</i>, for her Peace and Vision
may understand what is meant by
<i>Hell</i>, and all that is written of it.</p>

<p>As then the Fathers had a cabalistical
Notion of <i>Hell</i>, which modern <i>Divines</i>
are Strangers to; so they had of <i>Satan</i>,
and the <i>Devil</i> and his Angels. I own
myself at a Loss for an express Testimony
out of the Fathers about <i>Satan</i> in the
Text before us; but according to their
Explications of <i>Satan</i> in other Places, nothing
more is meant by him here than,
"That furious Principle and Temper in
Man that is not only averse to Liberty
in Religion, but for binding, restraining,
and tying down the Church and Christian
People to certain Opinions and Ways
of Worship." In such a State of Bondage
has the Woman of the Church been
kept, by such a <i>Satan</i>, in one Order of Men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43_Book2" id="Page_43_Book2">[Pg 43]</a></span>
or other, for all Ages past. And that this is a
right and primitive Notion of <i>Satan</i>, I could
prove by Authorities enough. <i>Origen</i> tells us<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
of the Names of Kings in prophetical
Scripture, which would be Enemies to
Christ's Church; but such Kings never did,
nor would personally exist; their Names,
according to Interpretation, standing only
for so many Sins and Vices, reigning in
Mankind. To the same Purpose he says<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
<i>human Vices are Devils</i>: And <i>Satan</i>
himself, (as the Word signifies <i>Adversary</i>)
is with him<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and the antient
<i>Jews</i> too, no other than an <i>Aversness</i> in
Man to the Will of God. I could quote
other Fathers to this Purpose; but being
sparing of my Pains at present, I refer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44_Book2" id="Page_44_Book2">[Pg 44]</a></span>
my Readers to my former<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> <i>Discourse</i>,
in which they will see the Opinion of the
Fathers about the <i>Devils</i> in the Madman,
and afterwards in the Herd of Swine; from
which let them judge, whether the Fathers
could have any other Notion of <i>Satan</i>
here, than what I have represented. It
is certain, and may be easily prov'd, that
by <i>Satan</i>, the <i>Dragon</i> and the <i>Devil</i>,
mentioned in the <i>Revelations</i>, nothing
more is to be understood, than a furious,
persecuting, satanical, and diabolical Temper
in Man; and if what St. <i>John</i> writes
of <i>Satan</i> be cabalistical and allegorical;
the other Assertions of the Evangelists and
Apostles about <i>him</i> will of Course come
under that Denomination; or the primitive
Rule of Interpretation of Scripture according
to the natural Signification of the Names
of Persons and Places is not good.</p>

<p>As then the <i>Woman</i> of the Gospel was,
as is supposed, <i>v.</i> 16. <i>bound by Satan,
loe, for eighteen Years</i>: So the foresaid
furious Principle in Man, which is a mystical
<i>Satan</i>, an <i>Adversary</i> to Liberty, has
bound the Church, <i>loe</i>, to the <i>eighteenth</i>
Century of Years: But she is to be entirely
released from this spiritual Bondage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45_Book2" id="Page_45_Book2">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and set at<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> <i>perfect Liberty</i> against the
acceptable and Evangelical Sabbath. And
here it is to be noted out of St. <i>Augustin</i>,
and most worthy of Observation it is, that
at the<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> same time, in which the Church
will be loosed from her Bondage; <i>Satan</i>
himself will<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> be <i>bound</i> and <i>chain'd</i> for
a<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> <i>thousand Years</i>, the time of the evangelical
Sabbath, that is, says <i>Ephr&aelig;m Syrus</i><a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
for ever. And how will our mystical
<i>Satan</i> or the <i>Dragon</i> be bound and chain'd?
Not with Chains or Links of Iron or other
Metal; but <i>Vinculis Rationis</i>, with the
Chains of Reasons and Arguments for
Christian Liberty, which will restrain the
<i>Adversary</i>, <i>Satan</i>, from any more Impositions
and Persecutions of the Church.
And I can't here but applaud the great
Mr. <i>Grounds</i> and Mr. <i>Scheme</i>, for their
Work and Labour of Love to Mankind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46_Book2" id="Page_46_Book2">[Pg 46]</a></span>
in making <i>Chains</i> of Argumentations for
Liberty, which I hope will prove of sufficient
Strength to bind <i>Satan</i> and restrain
him (in Dr. <i>Rogers</i>, Bishop <i>G&mdash;bs&mdash;n</i>,
and others his Angels) from giving any
more Molestation to Christian Philosophers
in their Enquiries after, and Lucubrations
on Divine Truth. All the Honour that I
aim at in that Work is, by the Help of
the Fathers, to point out that anti-Christian
Principle or Temper in the <i>Clergy</i><a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
which, for its <i>Averseness</i> to Liberty,
is called <i>Satan</i>; for its <i>Calumnies</i>, is called
the <i>Devil</i>; for its <i>Furiousness</i>, is called
the <i>Dragon</i>; and for its <i>Unreasonableness</i>,
is called the <i>Beast</i>, to the intellectual
Views of Mankind, and to direct
them how to apprehend and lay hold on
it.</p>

<p>Our Saviour, according to <i>Origen</i>, had
never call'd <i>Peter</i>,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> <i>Satan</i>, if <i>Satan</i>
had been any Thing else than <i>Man-averse</i>
to the Will of God.</p>

<p>And thus have I spoken to the Miracle
of <i>Jesus</i>'s healing the <i>Woman of her Spirit
of Infirmity, whom Satan had bound
and bow'd down</i>, which, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47_Book2" id="Page_47_Book2">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the Letter, is no Miracle at all; and
some Parts of the Story are improbable
and incredible; but the mystical Completion
of it will be most prodigious, and a
Demonstration not only of Christ's Power
and Presence in his Church, but of his
<i>Messiahship</i>, in as much as a vast Number
of Prophecies of the <i>Old Testament</i>, more
than can soon be collated to this Purpose,
will thereupon receive their Accomplishment.
And so I come to a</p>

<p>3. <i>Third</i> miraculous Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s,
that is of his telling (<i>John</i> iv.) the Woman
of <i>Samaria</i> her Fortune, <i>of having
had five Husbands, and being then an
Adulteress</i>, &amp;c. in which there is a notable
Miracle display'd, in the Opinion of
our <i>Divines</i>, that proves <i>Jesus</i>'s Omniscience,
or he could not so have search'd
into the Heart of this Woman, and told
her such Occurrences, that concern'd her
Life past. I thought once of transcribing
here entirely this Story; and so I would,
but that it is a long one, and might have
set some Readers, who are by this time
awaken'd to pry into the Absurdities of the
Letter, a laughing, before I had time my
self regularly to animadvert on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48_Book2" id="Page_48_Book2">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether there was any Truth at all in
the Letter of this Story, I should much
have questioned, but that some Fathers
write of it, as if they believed it literally,
tho' they make a mystical and allegorical
Explication of the whole and every part
of it. And I, having a sincere Veneration
for the Fathers, will not contradict them,
(and I hope this Concession will please the
<i>Clergy</i>) but, for all that, can't like any
part of this Story literally, but could almost
wish, that the Fathers, for the Honour
of <i>Jesus</i>, had made the whole no
other than a Parable.</p>

<p>It's strange that no <i>Jews</i> or <i>Infidels</i>
have as yet ludicrously treated this Story
to the, almost, Confutation of our Religion.
If their Tongues had not been ty'd
by the aforesaid <i>Satan</i> or <i>Adversary</i> to
Liberty, I can't think but they must have
made some pleasant Animadversions upon
it before now. If such a broken, elliptical,
and absurd Tale had been told of
any other Impostor in Religion; the Wits
of our <i>Clergy</i> had been at Work to expose
it plentifully; and indeed there's no need
of much Wit to make this Tale nauseous
and ridiculous to vulgar Understandings.</p>

<p>I shall not myself here make all the Remarks
I can to the Disadvantage of this
Story: I am not as yet so disposed to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49_Book2" id="Page_49_Book2">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Scoffers and <i>Infidels</i> laugh at the <i>Clergy</i>
for their Adherence to the Letter of it.
All I shall do now, is to make my Observations
on the two Uses, that the Clergy
very seriously put this Story to, and they
are,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, to prove the Expectation that
there was amongst the <i>Samaritans</i>, of a
<i>Messiah</i> to come; And</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, to prove <i>Jesus</i>'s Omniscience,
or he could not have entered into the Heart
of the Woman, and told her, that she
had had five Husbands, and was then an
Adulteress. To these two Purposes, I
find this Story urged by our <i>Divines</i>, and
I must needs say, as to the</p>

<p><i>First</i> of them; it is rightly from hence
asserted by the<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Lichfield</i>
and others, that the <i>Samaritans</i> had an
Expectation of a <i>Messiah</i>: But why then
did not the <i>Bishop</i> and others, who are
now in Quest after Arguments of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Messiahship, prove him hence to be the
<i>Messiah</i>, because he told the <i>Samaritan</i>
woman her Fortune? If this was a real
and substantial Argument to her of <i>Jesus</i>'s
<i>Messiahship</i>, it ought to be urg'd by the
Clergy at this Day. The Controversy
about <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship is now on foot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50_Book2" id="Page_50_Book2">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Why do the Advocates for it overlook this
Proof of it? Why, because, as I suppose,
they are aware, that <i>Infidels</i> would make
sport with it. But if <i>Jesus</i>'s telling the
Woman her Fortune was no real and
conclusive Argument of his being the <i>Messiah</i>;
St. <i>John</i> has told us an impertinent
Tale of a simple Woman, upon whose
Credulity and false Notions <i>Jesus</i> palm'd
himself as the true <i>Messiah</i>; and whether
he did not ill thus to banter and deceive
the Woman, let any one judge.</p>

<p>But let us here behold the Difference
amongst the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Samaritans</i>, as to
the Expectation of a <i>Messiah</i>. Some of
the old <i>Jews</i>, like the Apostles, expected
the <i>Messiah</i> would be a temporal Prince,
a great Warriour and Conqueror of the
World. Others<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> of them, like the
Fathers, expected he would be a Prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51_Book2" id="Page_51_Book2">[Pg 51]</a></span>
like <i>Moses</i> in all Things, and deliver his
People out of another <i>Egypt</i>: But here
the <i>Samaritans</i> expected he would be a
<i>Conjurer</i> and <i>Fortune-Teller</i>; or there is
no Sense in what the Woman said to the
Men of the City, <i>v.</i> 29. <i>Come and see a
Man that has told me all that I have
done</i>, particularly my Fortune of having
had five Husbands, and being now an
Adulteress, <i>Is not this the Christ?</i> What
could she mean, but that the <i>Messiah</i>
would be a strolling <i>Fortune-Teller</i>, to inform
People of the Events of their Lives
past and to come? And <i>Jesus</i> to humour
the Woman in her Conception of himself
and of the <i>Messiah</i>, says to her, <i>v.</i> 26.
<i>I that speak unto thee, am He.</i> Whether
our <i>Divines</i> like <i>Jesus</i> the better for
this Story of him literally, I can't tell;
but I am sure they dislike the Fortune-telling
Trade at this Day in others, and
believe it to be all Fraud, and are for punishing
strolling <i>Gypsys</i> for Cheats, who
practice it; and in the last Age were intent
on the<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Prosecution of judicial Astrologers,
who pretended to it: And if
antient History had furnish'd us with an Instance
of the Punishment of a pretended
<i>Fortune-Teller</i> in the Reign of <i>Tiberius</i>,
they could not have found Fault with it.
Whether any Accusations were laid against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52_Book2" id="Page_52_Book2">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<i>Jesus</i> for such his Delusions of the People,
we know not. Evangelical History is silent,
or the <i>Evangelists</i> have prudently suppressed
it. But I much wonder, that our
<i>Gypsys</i>, from this Story, don't account
themselves the genuine Disciples of <i>Jesus</i>,
being endu'd with the like Gifts and exercising
no worse Arts, than he himself
practised.</p>

<p>If the <i>Samaritans</i> did not expect the
<i>Messiah</i> would be a <i>Fortune-Teller</i>; how
came the Thought into the Woman's Head,
that <i>Jesus</i> was the <i>Messiah</i>, because he
had told her, her Fortune? What can our
<i>Divines</i> say to it? Why, they must either
say, that his telling the Woman her Fortune
was a real Proof of his <i>Messiahship</i>;
or that the Woman was foolish and credulous,
and drew a false Conclusion; and
if she had not been an impudent and graceless
Whore, would have gone away blushing,
and never have divulg'd, as the Text
supposes she did, her Shame to the Men
of <i>Sychar</i>, who too had but little Wit,
or they had never stir'd from their Homes,
to see such a Fortune-Teller upon the Report
of a poor Whore.</p>

<p>But the Men of the City had their Fortunes
too told them by <i>Jesus</i>, and they
concluded him to be the <i>Messiah</i> upon it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53_Book2" id="Page_53_Book2">[Pg 53]</a></span>
or there is no Sense in what they <i>v.</i> 42. <i>said
to the Woman, Now we believe not because
of thy Saying, for we have heard him
ourselves, and know that this is indeed
the Christ</i>: What could they hear, but
their Fortunes, as the Woman had before?
And if <i>Jesus</i>, whose Ability at all fair
Questions in the magic Art I don't question,
did tell them their Fortunes; I hope
he had more Prudence than to talk to them
in common of their Fornications and Adulteries,
which might occasion domestick
Jarrs, and the Breach of good Neighbourhood
amongst them; but if he directed
any of them to find their lost Cattle, and
help'd them again to their stolen Goods,
he did well, and they alone did amiss, to
conclude thereupon, <i>that he was indeed
the Christ</i>. Let our <i>Divines</i> now judge
whether I have not made a natural and excellent
Comment on this part of the Story,
which relates to the Expectation and
Opinion, which the <i>Samaritans</i> had of a
<i>Messiah</i> to come. But,</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, From this Story literally our
<i>Divines</i> prove <i>Jesus</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Omniscience;
and <i>Cardiognostick</i> Power to tell what was
in the Hearts and Thoughts of Man. But
how so? Is it because he told a Woman,
that she was an Adulteress, and had had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54_Book2" id="Page_54_Book2">[Pg 54]</a></span>
five Husbands? Where's the Consequence?
<i>Duncan Campbel</i>, and other <i>Moorfields</i>-judicial-Astrologers
have done greater Feats
at Conjuration than <i>this</i>, and never were
thought to be Omniscient. And for any
Thing appears in this Story of our Saviour,
it might be all Cheat and Fraud in
him. If <i>Infidels</i> should assert it, our <i>Divines</i>
could not disprove it. If they
should say, it was possible for <i>Jesus</i> to
get Intimations of these and other Circumstances
of the Woman's Life, before he
attempted to tell her, her Fortune; we
can't say, that this is an impious and unreasonable
Suggestion, since it is the common
Subtilty of delusive Fortune-Tellers,
to get what Intelligence they can by Insinuations
and Informations, before they utter
their Oracles, and ambiguous Responses
to simple poor Folks. And there is one
Circumstance in this Story, that looks very
ill upon <i>Jesus</i>, and is enough to make
him suspected for a Cheat in his pretended
Art, and that is, he seems to draw the
Woman in by a<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> <i>Wile</i> to hear her Fortune,
saying to her, <i>v.</i> 16. <i>Woman go,
call thy Husband</i>; upon whose denying
she had any Husband, Jesus was forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55_Book2" id="Page_55_Book2">[Pg 55]</a></span>
very forward to surprize her with his
Knowledge of her having had five Husbands,
and living then in Adultery; which
raising the silly Woman's Admiration of
his prophetick and soothsaying Talent, he
closes with her Conceptions, and what
upon other Occasions, before wiser People,
he was<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> backward to own, says to
her, <i>that he was the Messiah</i>; and so
he pass'd for the <i>Messiah</i> with her and
the Men of <i>Sychar</i>, who had no more
Wit than to receive him for such, upon
such Proof, and gave him Entertainment
for no less than <i>v.</i> 40. <i>two Days</i>. I am
glad we hear of no Money, he squeez'd
out of them for the exercise of his prophetick
Art, which our <i>Divines</i> would have
made an Argument of their Divine Right
to Tythes, Fees, and Stipends for their
Divinations.</p>

<p>But no more of this silly Story according
to the Letter. To point at it is
enough to expose it to the considerate and
unprejudiced. I could not help saying so
much as I have; because it is necessary to
form some Invective against the Letter, to
make way for the Reception of the mystical
and allegorical Interpretation of it,
which I am now to speak to.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56_Book2" id="Page_56_Book2">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>Tho' the Fathers, against whose Authority
I dare not write, or I should be tempted
to it in this Case, acknowledge the
Letter of this Story, suspecting only some<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
particular Passages of it; yet they
look upon the whole, for all that, as a<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
typical Narration, and endeavour at the
mystical Construction of all and every
part of it. St. <i>Augustin</i>, as if he was
afraid some Christians of after Times should
espouse, as our Divines do, only the Letter,
prefaces his Exposition of this Story
with these Words, saying,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> <i>There are
mysteries in all the Sayings and Actions
of our Saviour, particularly in the Story
of the Woman of</i> Samaria, <i>and whoever
carelesly and imprudently</i> (meaning literally)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57_Book2" id="Page_57_Book2">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<i>interprets it, will advance erroneous
and pernicious Doctrine</i>; which, if
modern Commentators had any Regard for
the Authority of St. <i>Augustin</i>, is enough
to deter them from their literal Expositions.
The most literal Interpreter among the Fathers,
whom I know of, is St. <i>Cyril</i>, and
he says<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> there is a Type and Parable in
this Story. But to descend to Particulars.</p>

<p>By the <i>Woman of Samaria</i> is to be understood
an<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Heretical and Adulterous
Church, which Jesus, <i>being wearied</i> with
her<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> corrupt State, will meet with
in <i>the sixth Hour</i>, that is in<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> the
<i>sixth grand Age</i> of the World. So, by
the By, according to the Fathers, <i>Jesus</i>
will come to, and meet with the <i>Samaritan</i>
Church to her Edification, at the
same time, that he cures the Church of
her <i>Issue of Blood</i> and <i>Spirit of Infirmity</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58_Book2" id="Page_58_Book2">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>And where did <i>Jesus</i> meet with the
Woman of <i>Samaria</i>? At <i>Jacob</i>'s <i>Well</i>,
where she was for Water to quench Thirst:
So at the<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> <i>Well</i> of the Holy Scriptures,
whose Sense lies deep as in a Well,
and flows with Knowledge as with Water,
will Christ then find his Church, drawing
and drinking of the<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Waters of the
Letter, which could not quench the
Thirst of the Soul hitherto: But in the
Perfection of Time, signified by the <i>sixth
Hour</i>, will Christ, according to the Fathers,
enable her to draw out of this
<i>Well</i> of the Profundity of the Scriptures,
spiritual Waters of Divine Knowledge,
which will daily more and more, like the
Fountains of the Waters of Life, arise
and flow in upon the Soul, and constantly
recreate and refresh her with Wisdom,
to her Delight and Satisfaction; so as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59_Book2" id="Page_59_Book2">[Pg 59]</a></span>
may be said never to thirst more, after the
Manner she does now.</p>

<p>And Jesus <i>then</i> told the Woman of <i>Samaria</i>,
<i>all that she had done</i>: So will
Christ in the <i>sixth Hour</i>, that is, towards
the latter End of the <i>sixth Age</i> of the
World, give the Woman of the Church
to understand <i>all that she has done</i>, according
to the Writings of <i>Moses</i> and the
Prophets, who, upon the Testimony of
the Fathers, have written a prophetical
History of her, in Types, Symbols and
Parables; which Understanding of the
Things that have been prophecy'd of her,
will enable her, of Consequence, to prove
and declare to the World, with Joy and
Pleasure, that <i>Jesus</i> is the true Messiah,
the Christ, and Fulfiller of the Law and
the Prophets.</p>

<p>But particularly, as <i>Jesus</i> then told
the Woman that <i>she had had five
Husbands, and was then an Adulteress</i>
with one who was not her true Husband:
So the Church will be made to apprehend,
according to<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> <i>Origen</i> and<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
St. <i>Augustin</i>, and others, how she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60_Book2" id="Page_60_Book2">[Pg 60]</a></span>
has had five Husbands of the five bodily
Senses, that is, metaphorically speaking,
has been <i>wedded</i> not only to sensual Pleasures,
but to the sensible Things of the
Letter of the five Books of <i>Moses</i>; and
that at present, consequently, she lives in
Adultery<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> with Anti-Christ, whom
the Fathers call the Devil, instead of the
Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of the Law,
who should be her true Spouse, whom
she should <i>call</i> for, and believe in.</p>

<p>And not only the Woman of <i>Samaria</i>,
but the Men of the City, <i>Sychar</i>, believ'd
<i>Jesus</i> to be the Messiah, <i>v.</i> 42, upon what
he said to themselves as well as to her:
So the Ministers of the Letter, who are
<i>Sycharites</i>, according to <i>Origen</i> and <i>Theophanes
Cerameus</i>, will be clearly convinced,
and be able to convince others,
that <i>Jesus is the Christ or Messiah</i>, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61_Book2" id="Page_61_Book2">[Pg 61]</a></span>
they shall hear, learn and apprehend from
the Spirit of the Law and the Prophets,
that the Church and all she has been doing,
was foretold and prophecy'd of.</p>

<p>Lastly, <i>Jesus</i>'s Disciples, <i>v.</i> 27. are said
<i>to Marvel that he talk'd with the Woman</i>.
What in the Name of Wonder, literally,
could be the Meaning of this?
Did they <i>Marvel</i> at <i>Jesus</i>'s Condescention
to speak to a Woman, as if the Sex was
beneath his Care? Or did they <i>Marvel</i>
that he who was very bashful, had Courage
to speak to one? Or did they <i>Marvel</i>
at his Conversation with a Whore, for
fear of his being tempted by her? Some
one or other of these must be the <i>Marvel</i>
of the Disciples; but how absurd and ridiculous
they all are, according to the
Letter, let a reasonable Man judge. But
mystically, the true Disciples of our Lord,
who understand the Mysteries of the Kingdom
of Heaven, will, when they are apprized
of <i>Jesus</i>'s spiritual Conversation
with his Church, and of all the Things
that she has done according to Prophecy,
<i>Marvel</i> with rapturous Astonishment at
the Wisdom and Power of God in the Accomplishment
of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>After such a Mystical and Allegorical
Manner, is every minute Circumstance of
this Story of the <i>Samaritan</i> Woman to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62_Book2" id="Page_62_Book2">[Pg 62]</a></span>
apply'd. St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> says there are
so many great Mysteries contain'd in it,
that they require much Time to go through
them all. I find it so, and that no less
than a Volume might be written of them,
out of the Fathers. But what I have
briefly here touch'd on, is enough to convince
any one of the Absurdities of the
Letter of this Miracle, which consisted in
the telling a Woman her Fortune, and such
a Fortune, as <i>Jesus</i> by Craft might come
to the Knowledge of. Therefore, for the
Honour of <i>Jesus</i>, let us look upon the
whole Story as a typical and parabolical
Representation of what would be mysteriously
and more wonderfully done by him.</p>

<p>And thus I have spoken to the three
Miracles, proposed to be treated on in this
Discourse. Before I enter upon my third
general Head, which is, <i>to consider what
Jesus means when he appeals to his Miracles
as to a Witness of his Divine Authority</i>;
I must take to Task some more
of his pretended Miracles even till I have
not left him a good, credible and substantial
Miracle, according to the Letter, to
appeal to. The Consequence of which
will be, that his mysterious Operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63_Book2" id="Page_63_Book2">[Pg 63]</a></span>
are to prove his Authority and Messiahship,
or we must give up him and his Religion
for a Piece of Fraud and Imposture.</p>

<p>What Miracles will be the Subject of
my next Discourse, I can't certainly foretell,
but there are many Historical as well
as miraculous Parts of <i>Jesus</i>'s Life, that
according to the Letter, are to be call'd
into Question; such as</p>

<p>The History of his riding on an Ass to
<i>Jerusalem</i>. I have given some Offence on
this Point already in my <i>Moderator</i>, and
ought to excuse or justify my self, by calling
the Fathers to Account for laughing at the
Letter of that Story. It was an untoward
saying of St. <i>Jerome</i>, that I there cited, and
suffered a Prosecution for: But it is a worse
Intimation of St. <i>John</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i>, who,
if there was any literal Truth in the Peoples
pulling off their Garments, and
Branches of Trees, and strewing them in
the Way of <i>Jesus</i>, will needs have it not respectfully
but mischievously done, to make
the Colt stumble, and so dismount his Rider.
And according to him it may be questioned,
whether the <i>Hosannahs</i> of the
People were of any more Respect to <i>Jesus</i>,
than the <i>Huzzahs</i> of a <i>Mob</i> would be to
the Bishop of <i>L&mdash;&mdash;n</i>, if to shew his
Meekness and Lowlyness, he should ride
upon an Ass, in his <i>Pontificalibus</i> through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64_Book2" id="Page_64_Book2">[Pg 64]</a></span>
this City. But I have here a momentous
Controversy to decide about the Beast <i>Jesus</i>
rode on. St. <i>Matthew</i> seems to say,
he rode upon both <i>Ass</i> and <i>Colt</i> together.
St. <i>Mark</i> and St. <i>Luke</i> say, he rode upon
the <i>Colt, on which Man never before sat</i>.
The Bishop of <i>Lichfield</i> says, he rode
upon the <i>Ass</i> (on which Man had before
sat) and the <i>Colt</i> ambled after. St. <i>Cyril</i>
and St. <i>Chrysostom</i> say, he rode upon the
<i>Colt</i>, and the <i>She-Ass</i> trotted after. St.
<i>John</i> the <i>Evangelist</i> says he rode upon
a <i>Mule</i>, or an οναριον Ass-like Creature of
the neuter Gender. The <i>Jewish Cabalists</i>
say, their <i>Messiah</i> was to ride on a great
huge <i>Ass</i>, big enough to carry him and
all true Israelites, and that the Ministers
of <i>Antichrist</i> would then hang an <i>A-ss</i>.
So do the great Doctors of the World
differ! To whom I shall decree the Prize
of Orthodoxy, I shan't foretell; but am
inclined to favour the Opinion of the <i>Cabalists</i>.
However, I shall be very grave
as well as learned on this Head: And if I
can, I will, to oblige Dr. <i>Sherlock</i>, hook
in a Digression about <i>Shilo</i>'s <i>binding his
Fole to the Vine, and his Asses Colt
to the choice Vine</i>: The Accomplishment
of which <i>literal</i> Prophecy seems to have
been drop'd in the Providence of God, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65_Book2" id="Page_65_Book2">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the <i>Dean</i> of <i>Chichester</i><a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> had never
stopt at it. I will endeavour to look it up,
in some Corner of History, if it be but to merit
the Praises of the <i>Master</i> of the <i>Temple</i>.</p>

<p>I must also sometime take into Consideration
the Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s Abode in
the Wilderness, forty Days, in Company
of the <i>Devil</i>, who tempted him. This
literally, as our <i>Divines</i> understand it, is
a Scandalous Story. The <i>Jews</i>, in our
Saviour's Time, said, that through <i>Belzebub</i>,
he cast out <i>Devils</i>; and their Posterity
have asserted, that he learn'd the
Magick Art of a <i>D&aelig;mon</i>. This Story
gives too much Grounds for such a Suspicion.
Our <i>Divines</i>, who should know
best, talk of abundance of Mischief, the
<i>Devil</i> has been permitted to do in the
World ever since; I hope it was not by
Compact and Agreement between them;
but it would have been of some Satisfaction
to the Contrary, if the <i>Evangelist</i> had
told us expresly upon what Terms they
mett and parted. As Fables go, it is said
to the Honour of St. <i>Dunstan</i>, that he
took the <i>Devil</i> by the Nose, when he
tempted him; and if <i>Jesus</i> had taken him
by the <i>Collar</i>, and thrust him into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66_Book2" id="Page_66_Book2">[Pg 66]</a></span>
<i>Dungeon</i>, and there chain'd him, and shut
<i>Hell-Gates</i> upon him; I appeal to honest
plain Christians, whether such an <i>Herculean</i>
Labour would not have pleased them
well. Ever since I read of <i>Martin Luther</i>'s
Conversation with the <i>Devil</i>, I have
had but indifferent Thoughts of his <i>Protestantism</i>;
and unless the Fathers turn
this Story before us into Mystery, Allegory
and Cabalism, I shall think ill of Christianity.</p>

<p>I should also take into Examination the
Story of an Angel's appearing to the Shepherds,
and saying to them; <i>Behold I
bring you Tidings of great Joy</i>, &amp;c. If
there was any Truth literally in <i>this</i> Story,
and in <i>that</i> of a Star's appearing to
the wise Men, there must be a great Mistake
in the Report of both of them. St.
<i>Matthew</i> and St. <i>Luke</i> have both blunder'd.
It was the Star that appear'd to
the Shepherds by Night; and the Angel
(I speak upon Reason and Authority) that
was sent to the wise Men. What then
to do with these two Stories, and to salve
the Credit of the <i>Evangelists</i>, I knew
not, till the Fathers directed me to the
Use of a mythological <i>Metamorphosis</i>:
And then I presently learn'd the Trick
on't, to transform Stars into Angels, and
Shepherds too, or Pastors of Christ's Flock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67_Book2" id="Page_67_Book2">[Pg 67]</a></span>
(which was the Difficulty) into wise Men;
and so I made one Moral or Mistery of
the two Fables.</p>

<p>I must also some Time take to task the
Story of the <i>many dead Bodies of the
Saints, that upon Christs Resurrection,
came out of their Graves, and appear'd
unto many</i>; which is too imperfectly related
to merit Credit. The <i>Evangelist</i>,
if he would have a reasonable Man believe
his Story, should have told us, who those
Saints were, and what Numbers of them;
and whether they appear'd to the converted
or unconverted <i>Jews</i>; whether they were
some of the Patriarchs and Prophets of old,
or some lately departed Disciples, who, for
all <i>Jesus</i>'s healing Power, died in the
Time of his Ministry; and whether there
were any Women among those Saints; and
whether they appear'd naked (as <i>Jesus</i>
modestly did to <i>Mary Magdalen</i>, unless he
flip'd himself by <i>Stealth</i> into the Cloths
of the Gardener, which might be the Reason
of her Mistake, for she suppos'd she saw
the Gardener) and whether they return'd
again to Corruption, or ascended into
Heaven. For want of these specifical Circumstances,
the <i>Evangelist</i> has told us a
Tale, that has neither Head nor Foot to it:
and unless the Fathers mystically answer,
to Satisfaction, every one of the aforesaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68_Book2" id="Page_68_Book2">[Pg 68]</a></span>
<i>Queries</i>, I'll reject this Story for mere Romance
and Imposture.</p>

<p>These and many other historical and
seemingly miraculous Stories of the Gospel,
are some time to be taken into Consideration;
for I will not give this Work over,
till I have demonstrated beyond all Contradiction,
that the evangelical Writings
are but the Shadow of Divine Mysteries;
and that literal Interpreters, whom<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
<i>Origen</i> calls <i>vulgar Capacities</i>, are under
a Mistake, if they think, they understand
any Thing, as they ought, of the four
Gospels.</p>

<p>I should conclude now, as it becomes a
<i>Moderator</i>, with an Address to <i>Infidels</i>
and <i>Apostates</i>, the great Combatants in
this Controversy. But I have not Room
to be as large, as I would, in my Exhortations
to them distinctly, so I can only
desire them to continue the Controversy
with Zeal and Vigour, not doubting but
it will end to the Honour of Jesus, the
Good of his Church, and the Happiness
of Mankind. The blessed Fruits of this
Controversy are already seen and felt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69_Book2" id="Page_69_Book2">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the almost Cure of a most malignant Distemper,
call'd <i>Bigottry</i>, which has been
the Bane of human Society, and in Times
past more destructive of the World than
either War or Pestilence. Go on then,
<i>Great</i> and <i>Good Sirs</i>, till the Cure is perfected.
And as you merit Praises and Rewards
for your several Labours; So I hope
you'll meet with them. The <i>Nobility</i>
and <i>Gentry</i>, of the Kingdom, as I learn,
are sensibly touch'd with the Usefulness of
this Controversy; whereupon it is to be
hoped the <i>Legislative Authority</i> will soon
give Thanks to the great Mr. <i>Grounds</i> and
Mr. <i>Scheme</i> for their Pains in it; and not
forget to do Justice to the <i>Bishops</i> and <i>Clergy</i>
according to their Merits. But I can't stay
here to talk more on this Head, being
obliged to make an Epistolary</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>P. S.</i> To Mr. <i>T. Ray</i>, the Author of
a <i>Discourse</i>, call'd <i>Our Saviour's Miracles
vindicated</i>, &amp;c. As I, <i>Sir</i>, enter'd
the <i>Press</i>, you came forth, or I might
possibly have paid more of my Respects to
you another Way. But upon mature Consideration,
I found a properer Reply could
not be made to you, than is the foregoing
Discourse; which, if you are not sick of
your former Performance, will find you
some more Work. And that you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70_Book2" id="Page_70_Book2">[Pg 70]</a></span>
write more pertinently against this Discourse,
than you did against my other,
I'll give you some Instructions, <i>viz.</i> if you
think of writing to the Purpose, you must
prove these two Things; <i>First</i>, that the
Fathers did not hold the Stories of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Miracles to be typical and figurative; and
<i>Secondly</i>, that <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles neither
will nor can receive a mysterious and more
wonderful Accomplishment. But you have
not said one Syllable to either of these
Points; consequently have written nothing
to the Purpose against me. As for Instance;
In the Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>'s <i>driving
the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple</i>:
You should prove, <i>First</i> that the Fathers
don't hold that Miracle to be typical of
the future Ejection of <i>Bishops</i>, <i>Priests</i>,
and <i>Deacons</i> out of the Church, that
make Merchandize of the Gospel: And <i>Secondly</i>,
that it was impossible that the Miracle
should receive such an Accomplishment.
But you have done nothing of this.
So, if you should attempt again to write
against this Discourse, as for Instance, against
my Explication of the Miracle of
<i>Jesus</i>'s healing the Woman, that <i>had an
Issue of Blood</i>; you must prove that <i>that</i>
Story neither was in the Opinion of the
Fathers Typical, nor could receive a mystical
Accomplishment; or you may as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71_Book2" id="Page_71_Book2">[Pg 71]</a></span>
well hold your Peace. And after all, whether
your Reasonings for the Letter of
Christ's Miracles, are equal to mine against
it, let our Readers judge, who will easily
discern, that you jump over my choicest
Invectives against the Letter, as if you was
afraid of being touch'd by them.</p>

<p>As to your charging me falsly in one or
two Places, with Misrepresentations of
the Fathers, I'll expostulate that Matter
with you, when I hear that the <i>Bishop</i> of
<i>London</i> gives your Performance, the Reputation
of a solid, and substantial one, by
a Change of your <i>Cloak</i> into a <i>Gown</i>,
which you seem to aim at; or you had
never so besmear'd the <i>Bishop</i> with your
Compliments, nor had been so mealy-mouth'd
as to the Point of Liberty.</p>

<p>But what need you, <i>Sir</i>, have told the
World, that you take me for an <i>Unbeliever
of the Scriptures</i>. If the <i>Bishop</i>'s
wise Prosecution of me for an <i>Infidel</i> had
not given you the Hint, you could never
of your self have made that Discovery.
And why did you not join the Fathers
with me in Unbelief? I thought I had
been of the same Faith with them. A
Man of your Penetration into another's
Principles, will, I suppose, from this
present going Discourse, conclude me to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72_Book2" id="Page_72_Book2">[Pg 72]</a></span>
a downright <i>Atheist</i>. And what must I do
then to clear my self!</p>

<p>If you write any more, <i>Sir</i>, I desire
you, without making more Haste than
good Speed, to be as expeditious as you
can; or you will not prevent my Publication
of another Discourse, like these
two, to the Honour of <i>Jesus</i>, to whom
be Glory for ever and ever. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p><i>n your</i> Sermon <i>before
the</i> Societies <i>for Reformation
of Manners, you
are pleased to give a
Character of my former</i>
Discourses on Christ's Miracles;
<i>which, tho' I don't at all like, yet I
thank you for the Favour of taking
Notice of them; a</i> Favour <i>that
I have long'd for from a considerable</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv_Book3" id="Page_iv_Book3">[Pg iv]</a></span>
Clergyman; <i>but could not flatter myself
with the Hopes of receiving it from
so great a</i> Prelate.</p>

<p><i>Some of the inferior</i> Clergy, <i>whom
I despise for their Ignorance and
Malice, have before in their Conversation
represented me as an</i> impious
<i>and</i> blasphemous Infidel; <i>and I have
met with Affronts for it: But I never
imagin'd that any, much less your</i> Lordship,
<i>would have ventur'd such a
Character of me from the</i> Press, <i>for
fear of a Resentment, which would not
be agreeable. Surely your</i> Lordship
<i>has not read my</i> Discourses, <i>but has
taken a Report of them upon Trust,
from some Ecclesiastical</i> Noodle; <i>or
you could never have been so much mistaken
about my Design in them</i>.</p>

<p><i>I took myself to be a</i> Christian <i>of
the same Faith with the Fathers of
the Church; and, without Vanity,
think, I have publish'd some Tracts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v_Book3" id="Page_v_Book3">[Pg v]</a></span>
in Defence of Christianity, equal, if
not superior to any Thing this Age has
produced. I repeatedly also in my</i> Discourses
on Miracles, <i>to obviate the
Prejudices of an ignorant</i> Clergy, <i>made
solemn Protestations of the Sincerity of
my Design, not to do Service to Infidelity,
but to make Way for the Demonstration
of</i> Jesus<i>'s Messiahship from
Prophecy: But all these Asseverations
of the Integrity of my Heart, it seems,
stand for nothing (and I don't wonder
at it) with the</i> Clergy, <i>who in their
Principles, their Oaths, and Subscriptions
are so accustom'd to prevaricate
with God and Man. I shall make no
more serious Protestations of my Faith,
but expect your</i> Lordship <i>should soon
publish a Defence of your foul</i> Charge
<i>against me, that I may see what Skill
you have in the impious and blasphemous
Writings of an</i> Infidel.</p>

<p><i>And if your railing</i> Accusation <i>be
not soon followed with a Dissertation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi_Book3" id="Page_vi_Book3">[Pg vi]</a></span>
of more Reason, I shall insist on a
publick Reparation of the Injury done
to my Reputation by your</i> vile <i>and</i>
slanderous <i>Sermon; and appeal to the
worshipful</i> Societies <i>for Reformation
of Manners, whether it be not just
and reasonable, you should do one or the
other</i>.</p>

<p><i>Now I have laid hold on your</i> Lordship,
<i>than whom I could not have wish'd
for an</i> Adversary, <i>that will do me
more Honour to overcome, I will hold
you fast; and you must expect to be
teaz'd and insulted from the</i> Press, <i>if
you enter not the Lists against me</i>.</p>

<p><i>A clear Stage</i>, my Lord, <i>and no
Favour. If you have the Sword of
the Spirit in your Hand, cut as sharply
as you can with it. I had conceiv'd a
great Opinion of your Learning, and
should have been a little apprehensive of
the Power of it; if you had not in your</i>
Sermon <i>betray'd as great Weakness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii_Book3" id="Page_vii_Book3">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Ignorance, as could be in a poor</i> Curat;
<i>or you had never asserted that the</i>
Greek <i>Commentators adher'd more
strictly, to the litteral Sense of the Holy
Scriptures; as if you knew not, that
St</i>. Theophilus <i>of</i> Antioch, <i>and even</i>
Origen <i>himself and others, the greatest</i>
Allegorists, <i>if a Comparison may be
made, were</i> Commentators <i>of the</i>
Greek <i>Church</i>.</p>

<p><i>The sooner your</i> Lordship <i>appears
from the</i> Press, <i>the better, in as much
as you may possibly prevent my Publication
of more</i> Discourses <i>of this
Kind. And that it may not be long
first, I will accept of a Dissertation
from you, on any two or three of the
Miracles, I have handled, as sufficient
for all. Take your Choice of them:
but don't I beseech you, touch the Miracle
of</i> Jesus<i>'s driving the</i> Buyers <i>and</i>
Sellers <i>out of the Temple, because it
is a</i> hot <i>one, and may possibly burn
your Fingers. The Miracles, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii_Book3" id="Page_viii_Book3">[Pg viii]</a></span>
have most ludicrously and, of consequence,
most offensively handled, are
the</i> two <i>of this present Discourse. If
you please</i>, my Lord, <i>let them be
the easy and short Task imposed on
you. If you can defend the Letter
of the Stories of these</i> two <i>Miracles,
I'll quietly give up the Rest to you.</i></p>

<h3>ON THE</h3>

<p>y two former Discourses
having met with a favourable
Reception, I am encourag'd
to go on and publish
another; which, without
any more Preface, I enter
upon, by a Repetition of three general
Heads, at first proposed to be spoken to,
and they were,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_Book3" id="Page_2_Book3">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>I. To show that the Miracles of healing
all Manner of bodily Diseases, which
<i>Jesus</i> was justly famed for, are none of the
proper Miracles of the <i>Messiah</i>, neither are
they so much as a good Proof of his divine
Authority, to found a Religion.</p>

<p>II. To prove, that the literal History of
many of the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>, as recorded
by the <i>Evangelists</i>, does imply Absurdities,
Improbabilities, and Incredibilities;
consequently they, either in whole or in
part, were never wrought, as they are
commonly believed now-a-days, but are
only related as prophetical and Parabolical
Narratives of what would be mysteriously
and more wonderfully done by him.</p>

<p>III. To consider, what <i>Jesus</i> means,
when he appeals to his Miracles, as to
a Testimony and a Witness of his divine
Authority; and to show that he could not
properly and ultimately refer to those he
then wrought in the <i>Flesh</i>, but to those
Mystical ones, that he would do in the
<i>Spirit</i>, of which those wrought in the Flesh
are but mere Types and Shadows.</p>

<p>Tho' I have already, spoken what may
be thought sufficient, to the first of these
Heads; yet I have several Things still, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_Book3" id="Page_3_Book3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
from Reason and Authority, to add to it;
but having not here a convenient Place for
that purpose, I defer it to a better Opportunity;
and so pass immediately to the
Resumption of my</p>

<p>II. Second general Head, and that is, to
prove, that the literal History of many of
the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>, as recorded by the
<i>Evangelists</i>, does imply Absurdities, Improbabilities
and Incredibilities; consequently
they, either in whole or in part
were never wrought, as it is commonly
believed now-a-days, but are only related,
as Prophetical and parabolical Narratives
of what would be mysteriously and more
wonderfully done by him.</p>

<p>To this Purpose I have taken into Examination
six of the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>, <i>viz.</i>
those.</p>

<p>1. Of his driving the Buyers and Sellers
out of the Temple.</p>

<p>2. Of his exorcising the <i>Devils</i> out of
the Mad-men, and sending them into the
Herd of Swine.</p>

<p>3. Of his Transfiguration on the Mount.</p>

<p>4. Of his healing a Woman, that had an
Issue of Blood, twelve Years.</p>

<p>5. Of his curing a Woman that had a
Spirit of Infirmity, eighteen Years, and</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_Book3" id="Page_4_Book3">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Of his telling the <i>Samaritan</i> Woman
her Fortune of having had five Husbands,
and being then an Adulteress with another
Man.</p>

<p>Whether I have not prov'd the Storys
of these Miracles, either in whole or in
part, to consist of Absurdities, Improbabilities,
and incredibilities, according to
the Proposition before us, I leave my <i>Readers</i>
to judge; and now will take in Hand</p>

<p>7. A Seventh Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>; <i>viz.</i>
that<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> <i>of his cursing the Figtree, for not
bearing Fruit out of Season</i>; which Miracle,
upon the bare mention of it, appears to be
such an absurd, foolish, and ridiculous, if
not malicious and ill-natured Act in <i>Jesus</i>,
that I question, whether, for Folly and Absurdity,
it can be equalled in any Instance
of the Life of a reputed wise Man. The
Fathers, such as <i>Origen</i>, St. <i>Augustin</i>, St.
<i>John of Jerusalem</i>, and others, have all said
as smart Things, as the wittiest Infidels
can, against the Letter of this Story. St.
<i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> very plainly says, that <i>this
Fact in Jesus</i>, upon Supposition that it was
done, was <i>a foolish one</i>. If therefore I treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5_Book3" id="Page_5_Book3">[Pg 5]</a></span>
this Story a little more ludicrously than
ordinary, and expose the Folly of the Fact
as well as of the modern Belief of it, I hope
their Authority and Example will plead
my Excuse for it.</p>

<p><i>Jesus</i> was hungry, it seems, and being
disappointed of Figs, to the Satisfaction of
his Appetite, cursed the Figtree. Why so
peevish and impatient? Our <i>Divines</i>,
when they please, make <i>Jesus</i> the most
patient, resign'd and easy under Sufferings,
Troubles and Disappointments, of any
Man. If he really was so, he could hardly
have been so much out of Humour, for
want of a few Figs, to the Allay of his
Hunger. But to curse the Figtree upon it,
was as foolishly and passionately done, as
for another Man to throw the Chairs and
Stools about the House; because his Dinner
is not ready at a critical Time, or before
it could be got ready for him.</p>

<p>But <i>Jesus</i> was hungry, some will say,
and the Disappointment provoked him.
What if he was hungry? He should, as
he knew the Return of his Appetite,
have made a better and more certain
Provision for it. Where was <i>Judas</i> his
Steward and Caterer with his Bag of
Victuals as well as Money? Poor Forecast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6_Book3" id="Page_6_Book3">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and Management amongst them, or
<i>Jesus</i> had never trusted to the uncertain
Fruits of a Figtree, which he espy'd at a
Distance, for his Breakfast.</p>

<p>And if <i>Jesus</i> was frustrated of a long'd-for
Meal of Figs, what need he have so
reveng'd the Disappointment on the<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
senseless and faultless Tree? Was it, because
he was forc'd to fast longer than usual
and expedient? not so, I hope neither:
Could not Angels, if he was in a desert
Place, have administered unto him? Or
could not he miraculously have created
Bread for himself and his Company, as
he multiplied or increased the Loaves for
his Thousands in the Wilderness? What
Occasion then for his being out of Humour
for want of Food? If he was of
Power to provide Bread for others on a sudden,
he might sure have supply'd his own
Necessities, and so have kept his Temper,
without breaking into a violent Fit of
Passion, upon present Want and Disappointment.</p>

<p>But what is yet worse, <i>the Time of
Figs was not yet</i>, when Jesus look'd and
long'd for them. Did ever any one hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7_Book3" id="Page_7_Book3">[Pg 7]</a></span>
or read of any thing more<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> unreasonable
than for a Man to expect Fruit out of
Season? <i>Jesus</i> could not but know this before
he came to the Tree, and if he had
had any Consideration, he would not have
expected Figs on it, much less, if he had
regarded his own Reputation, as a wise
Man, would he have so resented the
Want of them. What, if a <i>Yeoman</i> of <i>Kent</i>
should go to look for <i>Pipins</i> in his Orchard
at <i>Easter</i>, (the supposed Time<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> that
<i>Jesus</i> sought for these Figs) and, because
of a Disappointment, cut down all his
Trees; What then would his Neighbours
make of him; Nothing less, than a <i>Laughing-stock</i>;
and if the Story got into our
publick News, he would be the Jest and
Ridicule of Mankind. How <i>Jesus</i> salv'd
his Credit upon this his wild Prank;
and prevented the Laughter of the <i>Scribes</i>
and <i>Pharisees</i> upon it, I know not; but I cannot
think of this Part of the Letter of this
Story, without smiling at it at this Day;
and wonder our <i>Divines</i> are not laugh'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8_Book3" id="Page_8_Book3">[Pg 8]</a></span>
out of Countenance for reading it gravely,
and having <i>Jesus</i> in Admiration for it.</p>

<p>Again, I would gladly know, whose Figtree
this was, and whether <i>Jesus</i> had any
legal Right to the Fruit, if haply he had
found any on it, or any Leave or Authority
to smite it with a Curse for its Unfruitfulness?
As to the Tree's being <i>Jesus</i>'s Property,
that could not be. For he was so
far from being either Landlord or Tenant,
that it's said he had not where to lay his
Head. During the Time of his Ministry,
he was but a Wanderer, like a Mendicant
Fryar, or an itinerant Preacher, and before
that Time was no better than a Journeyman
Carpenter (of whose Workmanship, I
wonder, the Church of <i>Rome</i> has no holy
Relicks, not so much as a Three-footed-stool,
or a Pair of Nutcrackers;) consequently
he had no House nor Land of his
own by Law, much less any Figtree, and
least of all <i>this</i> which he espy'd at a distance
in his Travels. How then had he
any Right to the Figs, if he had met with
any? I hope he ask'd Leave beforehand of
the Proprietor, or <i>Infidels</i> will say of him,
that if he had had an Opportunity he
would have been a <i>Rob-Orchard</i>. And it
he had no Right to the Fruit, much less to
smite the Tree with a Curse; where was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9_Book3" id="Page_9_Book3">[Pg 9]</a></span>
his Honour,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> <i>his Justice</i>, his Goodness,
and his Honesty in this Act? The <i>Evangelists</i>,
if they would have us to think,
<i>Jesus</i> did no wrong to any Man, should
have left us somewhat upon Record, to Satisfaction,
in this Case; or <i>Infidels</i>, who
have here Scope for it, will think worse
of <i>Jesus</i>, than possibly he may deserve.
Whether <i>Jesus</i>, modestly speaking, met
with any Blame or Reprimand from the
Proprietor, for his Act of Execration, none
can affirm or deny. But if any one so
spitefully and maliciously should destroy
almost any other Tree, whether fruitful
or not, of another Man's, in this Country,
he would have good Luck, if he escaped
the House of Correction for it.</p>

<p>And what now have our <i>Divines</i> to say,
to all this Reasoning against the Letter of
this Story? Nothing more than "That
the Act of cursing the Figtree, whether
it be at this Distance of Time reconcilable
to Reason, Justice and Prudence
or not, was a supernatural Work,
above the Power of Nature or Art to
imitate; consequently it was a Miracle,
and they will admire and adore <i>Jesus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10_Book3" id="Page_10_Book3">[Pg 10]</a></span>
for it." And to agree with them at
present, that it was a real Miracle, and
a supernatural Event, yet I hope, they'll
acknowledge, that if <i>Jesus</i>, as St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
says, had, instead of cursing the
Figtree, made a dry, dead and withered
one, immediately to bud, flourish and revive,
and in an Instant to bring forth
ripe Fruits, out of Season, it would have
pleased them much better. Such an Instance
of his Power had been an indisputable
Miracle: Such an Instance of his
divine Power had carry'd Goodness along
with it, and none of the foresaid Exceptions
could have been made to it: Such
an Instance of his Almighty Power, had
been a Demonstration of his being Lord
of the Creation, and Author of the Fruits
of the Earth for the Use of Man, in
their Season, or he could not have produced
them out of Season: In such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11_Book3" id="Page_11_Book3">[Pg 11]</a></span>
an Instance of Power, his Divine Care
and Providence against Hunger and Want
would have been visible; and it would
have been an Admonition to us, to depend
daily upon him for the Comforts
and Necessaries of Life: Such an Instance
of his Power would have been, as St.
<i>Augustin</i> says above, like his Miracles of
healing Diseases, of making the Languid,
<i>Sound</i>; and the Feeble, <i>Strong</i>; and we
might more certainly have inferr'd from
one with the other, that both were the
Operations of a good God. But this
Instance of his cursing the Figtree in this
Fashion spoils the Credit, and sullies the
Glory of his other Miracles. It is in its own
Nature of such a malevolent Aspect, that
its enough to make us suspect the Beneficence
of <i>Christ</i> in his other Works, and to
question whether there might not be some
latent Poyson and diabolical Design under
the Colour of his fairer Pretences to Almighty
Power. It is so like the malignant
Practices of <i>Witches</i>, who, as Stories go,
upon Envy, Grudge, or Distaste, smite
their Neighbours Cattle with languishing
Distempers, till they die, that it's hard,
if not impossible, to distinguish one from
the other, in Spite and Malice. If <i>Mahomet</i>,
and not <i>Jesus</i>, had been the Author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12_Book3" id="Page_12_Book3">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of this Miracle, our <i>Divines</i> would presently
have discover'd the <i>Devil</i>'s Foot
in it, and have said that <i>Satan</i> drew him
into a Scrape, in the Execution of this
mad and foolish Frolick, on purpose to expose
<i>him</i> for a <i>Wizard</i> and <i>his</i> Musselmen
of all Ages since for <i>Fools</i> in believing
on him. The Spirit of <i>Christ</i>,
who is all Love and Mercy, should, one
would think, breath forth nothing but
Goodness and Kindness to Mankind; but
that such a pestilential Blast, like a mortiferous
North-East Wind in some Seasons,
should proceed from his Mouth, to the
Destruction of another Man's harmless and
inoffensive Tree, is what none upon Earth
can account for.</p>

<p>Our <i>Divines</i>, one or other of them,
have publish'd several notable Notions about
Miracles, and have laid down good
Rules to distinguish <i>true</i> from <i>false</i> ones;
but none of them, as far as I perceive,
have taken any Pains to shew the Consistence
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles to their own
Rules and Notions. Mr. <i>Chandler</i>, (who
as the <i>Archbishop</i><a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> says, has rightly
slated the Notion of a Miracle) among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13_Book3" id="Page_13_Book3">[Pg 13]</a></span>
his Rules of judging by whom Miracles
are perform'd, says,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> <i>That the Things
pretended to be done, are to be such, as that
it is consistent with the Perfections of God
to interest himself in</i>; and again, <i>they must
be such as answer to the Character of God
as a good and gracious Being</i>; and again,
<i>It seems reasonable to believe, that whenever
the first and best of Beings is pleased to send
an extraordinary Messenger with a Revelation
of his Will, he will furnish him with
such Proofs of his Mission, as may argue,
not only the Power of him in whose Name
be comes, but his Love to Mankind, and his
Inclination to do them good</i>. I have no Dislike
to these Notions of Mr. <i>Chandler</i>; but
as it is not to be questioned, that he
(and the <i>Archbishop</i> too) had this Miracle
of <i>Jesus</i>'s cursing the Figtree, and
some others, as of his <i>boisterous driving
the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple</i>;
of <i>his sending the Devils into the Herd of
Swine</i>; of <i>his turning Water into Wine
for the Use of Men, who had before well
drank</i>, &amp;c. in his View, when he gave
forth the foresaid Rules; (for acute and
learned Writers in Theology are supposed
to have their Wits about them;) so it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14_Book3" id="Page_14_Book3">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to be hop'd that he or the <i>Archbishop</i> will
soon publish somewhat to reconcile these
Miracles of <i>Jesus</i> to their own Notions;
tho' I don't expect it before <i>latter Lammas</i>.</p>

<p>But after all, it may be questioned, if
Infidels should go about it, whether this
Work of <i>Jesus</i> was miraculous; and whether
there was not more of the Craft of
Man, than of the Power of God in it;
or to use Mr. <i>Chandler</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Words,
whether it don't <i>look like the little Tricks
and cunning Deceits of Impostors</i>. St. <i>Matthew</i>
says, <i>presently the Figtree withered
away</i>; but this <i>presently</i> is an indeterminate
Time, and may be understood of a
Day, or a Week or two, as well as of the
Moment in which the Words were spoken,
<i>Let no Fruit grow on thee henceforward for
ever</i>. St. <i>Mark</i> says, <i>that in the Morning
as the Disciples passed by; they saw the
Figtree dry'd up from the Roots</i>, which
was at least the Day<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> after the Curse
was utter'd, so that there was certainly
four and twenty Hours for its withering;
and if it is said that the <i>Tree dry'd up from
the Roots</i>, it does not imply that the
Trunk of it perish'd, or was reduc'd to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15_Book3" id="Page_15_Book3">[Pg 15]</a></span>
nothing; but only that the green Leaves
of the Whole, and of every Part of it,
were in a withering Condition: And might
not all this be done without a Miracle?
What if <i>Jews</i> and <i>Infidels</i> should say, that
<i>Jesus</i>, being minded to impose on his Disciples
and Followers, took a secret Opportunity
beforehand to lay his Carpenter's
Ax to the Root of this Tree, and so
imperceptibly circumcised it, as that the
Leaves did, what they will do, wither in
a Night and a Day's Time. God forbid,
that I should think, <i>Jesus</i> did so; but as
to the Possibility of such a Fraud in an
Impostor, none can doubt of it.</p>

<p>I am so far from thinking there was any
such Fraud in this supposed Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>,
that I don't believe it was at all done
by him according to the Letter: And for
this I have not only a clear and intrinsick
Proof from the Story itself; but the Authority
of the Fathers. St. <i>Ambrose</i>, treating on
the Parable of the Figtree in<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> St.
<i>Luke</i>, intimates, that what St. <i>Matthew</i>
and St. <i>Mark</i> write of <i>Jesus</i>'s cursing the
Figtree, is but<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Part of the same Parable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16_Book3" id="Page_16_Book3">[Pg 16]</a></span>
And St. <i>John</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i><a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
says expressly enough, that the three <i>Evangelists</i>
write of one and the same Figtree,
consequently parabolically, and that,
what St. <i>Matthew</i> and St. <i>Mark</i> write of
it, was no more a literal Transaction, than
the Parable in St. <i>Luke</i>. Thanks to these
holy Fathers for their ridding us of the
Belief of the Letter of this Story, which
otherwise might have perplex'd us with its
Absurdities before urg'd. And to their
Opinion I desire it may be added and considered,
whether it be not as reasonable
in itself to take what the three <i>Evangelists</i>
write of this Figtree as Part of one
Story, as well as, what they write of the
<i>Woman with her Issue of Blood</i>, and of
<i>Jesus's calling the Devils out of the Madmen</i>,
and of other Miracles which are but
several Relations of the same Story, Parable
or Miracle, Neither is it any Argument
for a literal Transaction of this Miracle,
that the <i>Evangelists</i> speak of it, as a
Thing done: For, as <i>Origen</i> says, there are
some Things spoken of in the <i>Evangelists</i>,
as Facts, which were never transacted; so
it is of the Nature of Prophecy (and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17_Book3" id="Page_17_Book3">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Saviour in his whole Life prophesied) to
speak of Things to come, as if they were
already past; because such Prophecies are
not to be understood till after their Accomplishment,
and then the Reason of
the Use of the <i>pr&aelig;ter</i>, instead of the <i>future</i>
Tense, in Prophecy, will be visible.
But what, in my Opinion, is an absolute
Demonstration, that there's no Truth
in the Letter of this Story, is, what our
Saviour adds, upon the Disciples wondering
at the sudden withering of the Figtree,
saying,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> <i>that if they had Faith they
should not only do what was done to the
Figtree; but should say to this Mountain</i>,
(that was near him, I suppose) <i>be thou
removed and cast into the Sea, and it shall
be done</i>. But these Things were never litterally
done by them, consequently <i>Jesus</i>
himself did not litterally curse the Figtree;
or the Disciples wanted Faith for the
doing the said Miracles, which is an Absurdity
to suppose; or <i>Jesus</i> talked idly
of a Promise to invest them with a Power,
they were never to be possess'd of. But of
what ill Consequence to Religion, either
of these Suppositions is, let the old Objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18_Book3" id="Page_18_Book3">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in <i>Paschasius Rathertus</i><a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> speak;
which I shall not stay here to urge and
revive; but only say at present, that if
<i>Jesus</i> actually cursed a Figtree, his Disciples
ought to have done so too, and to remove
Mountains. If we adhere to the
Letter in one Case, we must in the other
also; but we are only to look to the
Mystery in both, or St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> will
tell us, that <i>Jesus</i> utter'd vain, empty and
insignificant Words and Promises.</p>

<p>St. <i>Augustin</i>, who believes no more of
the Letter of this Story, than I do, says,
that the Works of <i>Jesus</i> are all figurative
and of a spiritual Signification, which is so
manifest from his Act of cursing the Figtree,
as Men must,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> <i>whether they will or
not</i> acknowledge it. But he is mistaken:
Tho' there might be none in his Time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19_Book3" id="Page_19_Book3">[Pg 19]</a></span>
who would question, that this supposed
Fact of <i>Jesus</i> had a mystical Signification;
yet if he had liv'd in our Days, he
would have met with <i>Divines</i>, who, for all
the foresaid Absurdities and their Cogency
to drive us to Allegory, do adhere to
the Letter only, whether the Truth, Credibility
and Reasonableness of it be defensible
or not. But then to do Justice to
St. <i>Augustin</i>'s Assertion, he would have
met with others, who <i>against their Wills</i>,
interpret this Miracle figuratively, such
as Dr. <i>Hammond</i> and Dr. <i>Whitby</i>, who
say, <i>Jesus</i> cursed the Figtree by way of
Type of the Destruction of the <i>Jewish</i>
State, which declined and wasted away
after the Similitude of this withering Tree.
But why then don't these <i>Commentators</i> allegorically
interpret and apply other Miracles
of our Saviour? Because they think
the Letter will stand good and abide the
Test without an Allegory. And why do
they allegorise this Miracle only? Because
of the Difficulties and Absurdities of
the Letter, which they can't account for.
And are these Reasons good? No, certainly:
The <i>Evangelists</i> should have made the
Distinction for them. They should have
told us, which Miracles are to be allegoris'd
and mystically applied, and which are not;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20_Book3" id="Page_20_Book3">[Pg 20]</a></span>
or we are to allegorise all or none at all.
And how came these modern Allegorists
of this Miracle to apply it as they do,
and to make it a mystical Representation
of the Ruin of the <i>Jewish</i> State?
Did they take up this Notion of their
own Heads, or did they borrow it of
the Fathers? Why in all Probability they
took the Hint from the Fathers; wherefore
then don't they, what none of them
do, cite and acknowledge their Authors
for it? Because, like Men of Subtilty,
they would be thought to devise it of
themselves; for if they had quoted the
Fathers for it, the Fathers would have
oblig'd them, upon their Authority, to
allegorise the rest of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles,
in the way that I have interpreted some of
them; but this would not have agreed with
their Stomachs for many Reasons. No
Thanks then to the aforesaid <i>Commentators</i>
for their allegorical Application of this
Miracle, which they are again to desert,
or abide the Consequence of allegorising
others also, which for their Interests and
Reputations they will not do. Therefore
let them return again to the Letter of
this Miracle, and say for it, what is all
that is to be said for it, with <i>Victor Antiochenus</i>,
an Apostatical Writer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21_Book3" id="Page_21_Book3">[Pg 21]</a></span>
fifth Century,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> <i>that when we read this
Passage of Scripture concerning the Figtree</i>,
Jesus <i>cursed, we ought not curiously
to enquire whether it was wisely
or justly done of</i> Jesus, <i>or not; but we
ought to contemplate and admire this
Miracle, as well as that of</i> Jesus'<i>s
drowning the Swine, notwithstanding some
think it void of the Face of Justice</i>.
Ay, ay, our <i>Divines</i> must allegorise all
<i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, or betake themselves
to this Opinion of <i>Victor</i>; which this
<i>Free-thinking</i> Age will hardly let them
quietly rest in. So, supposing our <i>Divines</i>
to be, what they generally are, still
Ministers of the Absurdity of the Letter,
I pass to the Consideration of the Authority
of the Fathers, and to see, whether
we can't learn of them this Parable of the
Figtree.</p>

<p>Who or what is meant by the Figtree
seems not to be agreed among the Fathers;
or, more properly speaking, they are not
agreed, all of them to apply it always to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22_Book3" id="Page_22_Book3">[Pg 22]</a></span>
one and the same Thing. Some, as<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
<i>Gregory</i> the <i>Great</i>, say Human Nature
or Mankind is typified by the Figtree.
Others, as<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> St. <i>Hilary</i>, say the
<i>Jewish</i> Church or State is meant by it.
Others, as<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> <i>Origen</i> say, it is a Type
of the Church of Christ. So do the Fathers
seem to be divided in their Opinions;
but it is without any Difference or Inconsistency
with each other. For as there is,
according to the Fathers, Mystery upon
Mystery in all the Actions of <i>Jesus</i>; so
I believe the Figtree here, as a Type, may
be properly enough apply'd to the foresaid
three Purposes. And if the Fathers had
been ask'd their Opinion in this Case, I
dare say, they would have said so too.
This is certain that <i>Origen</i><a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> understands
it as applicable to the <i>Jewish</i> as
well as the <i>Christian</i> Church. And St.
<i>Augustin</i>, as Occasion offers itself, takes
it in the foresaid three Senses. When they
understand it as a Type of all Mankind,
they say that the <i>three Years</i> of its Unfruitfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23_Book3" id="Page_23_Book3">[Pg 23]</a></span>
are to be interpreted of the<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
<i>three grand Periods</i> of the World;
the <i>one</i> before the Law of <i>Moses</i>; <i>another</i>
under the Law; and the <i>third</i> under the
Gospel; at the Conclusion of which <i>third</i>
Period, as it was an ancient and common
Opinion, <i>Jesus</i> in Spirit would come to
his Figtree of Mankind, and animadvert
on them for their Unfruitfulness, not by
any Destruction of human Nature, but by
a Cessation of its Unfruitful State, which
then will wither away, and be turn'd into a
fruitful one against the grand Sabbath, or
acceptable Year, which is the Year signified
in the Parable, <i>that it is to be let alone
to bring forth Fruit in</i>. They that understand
the Figtree as a Type of the <i>Jewish</i>
State, mean by the <i>three Years Jesus</i> came
to it, the <i>three Years</i> of his preaching among
the <i>Jews</i>; at the End of which, after
<i>Christ</i>'s Passion and Resurrection, the
<i>Jewish</i> State, like the Figtree, withered away,
and, for its Unfruitfulness, was rooted
up. They, that understand the Figtree
as a Figure of the Church of <i>Christ</i>, by
the <i>three Years</i>, mean the apocalyptical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24_Book3" id="Page_24_Book3">[Pg 24]</a></span>
<i>twelve hundred and sixty Days</i> (that is,
three Years and a half) of the Church's
barren and unfruitful State in the Wilderness,
at the Conclusion of which, the Fathers
say, <i>Jesus</i> will come again to his
Church or Figtree, seeking Fruit on it.</p>

<p>Some perhaps may be ready here to
interpose with a Question, and say, how
will <i>Jesus</i> then come to his Church? I
have carefully perused the Fathers upon
this Question, and can't find that they
mean any more by <i>Christ</i>'s second or spiritual
Advent, than that clear <i>Truth</i>, right
<i>Reason</i> and divine <i>Wisdom</i> (which are the
mystical Names of <i>Jesus</i>) will descend upon
the Church, on the Clouds of the
Law and the Prophets, to the Removal
of her unfruitful and unprofitable Errors,
and to enable her to bring forth the Fruits
of the Spirit, against the grand Sabbath.
Neither can any reasonable Man conceive
how otherwise<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> <i>the Lord should
come</i>, (not <i>with ten thousand of his Saints</i>,
as our Translation has it, but) εν μυριασιν
αγιαις αυτου, that is, as <i>Origen</i> interprets, <i>in
his holy thousands</i> of Allegorists ποιησαι κρισεν,
<i>to criticise upon all</i> the Scripture, and
to convince <i>Ministers of the Letter</i> of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25_Book3" id="Page_25_Book3">[Pg 25]</a></span>
abominable Errors, and of their horrid
Blasphemies spoken, preach'd and printed
against the Holy, (Ghost or) Spirit
of the Law and Prophets. As to that
literal and common Pulpit-Story (with
all its Appendages) of <i>Jesus</i>'s second Coming
on &aelig;therial Clouds, as on a Wool-sack,
in his human, tho' glorious and majestick
Appearance, for the Resurrection
of Mens Bodies, by the Sound of a Trumpet,
in the Audience of the Dead, <i>&amp;c.</i> it is the
most absurd, nonsensical and unphilosophical,
(such groundless and worthless Stuff
have the <i>Clergy</i> sold and preach'd to God's
People!) that ever was told against Reason,
against prophetick and evangelical Scripture,
and against other antient and good
Authority. It is no Place here to multiply
Testimonies and Arguments to either of
these Purposes which my Readers, if they
do but attend, will see no Occasion for.
But if our <i>Divines</i> should think I have
put a false Gloss on the Text of St. <i>Jude</i>
above, I have a Bundle of Arguments and
Testimonies to produce in Defence of it,
at their Service.</p>

<p>In the Parable of St. <i>Luke</i>, it is said,
<i>Lo, these three Years come I seeking Fruit on
this Figtree</i>; as if <i>Jesus</i> came annually and
successively for <i>three Years</i> together: but
according to the Original, it ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26_Book3" id="Page_26_Book3">[Pg 26]</a></span>
read, <i>Lo, it is three Years and I now come</i>,
or, <i>Lo, the three Years are now past, and I
come</i>. And here it is to be noted, that
whether we understand the Figtree, as a
Figure of the Church in particular, or of
Mankind in general; the mystical Number
of <i>three Years</i> will terminate about the
same Time, against the Evangelical Sabbath,
on which the Unfruitfulness of the
Church, or of Mankind, according to the
Fathers, is to have an End put to it.</p>

<p>And <i>Jesus</i>, when he came to the Figtree,
<i>found nothing thereon but Leaves only</i>:
So <i>Jesus</i>, when he comes to his Church,
will find nothing in her but Leaves only.
And what is here meant by Leaves? Let
the Fathers, such as<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> St. <i>Hilary</i>, St.
<i>John</i><a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> <i>of Jerusalem</i>, and<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> St. <i>Theophylact</i>
tell us, who by Leaves understand
a vain and empty Appearance of Wisdom
and good Works, or the Words and
Letter of the Scriptures, which are the
Leaves of the Oracle, without any Figs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27_Book3" id="Page_27_Book3">[Pg 27]</a></span>
spiritual Interpretations of them. And whether
this ben't the Case of the Church at
present, our <i>Divines</i> are to consider. The
Figs that <i>Jesus</i> may be supposed to look
for at his Coming, are not only the Fruits
of the Spirit mention'd by St. <i>Paul</i>, but<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
<i>spiritual Interpretations</i> of the Scriptures,
which St. <i>Jerome</i><a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> says are
<i>mystical Figs</i>; because, as ripe Figs are
sweet to the Palate of our Mouths, so are
they no less delicious to the Soul of Man.</p>

<p>But <i>Jesus</i> is said to be <i>hungry</i> after
Figs: so will <i>Jesus</i> in Spirit <i>hunger</i> for
the mystical Figs of his Church, that is,
as <i>Origen</i><a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> rightly interprets, he will
earnestly desire, like a Man that is hungry,
the Fruits of the Spirit in his Church,
which will be as grateful to him as Figs
can be to a Man naturally. To understand
this Expression of <i>Jesus</i>'s <i>Hunger</i> literally, is
such a mean Circumstance of Life, that
unless it be, what's next to impossible, necessarily
introductory to some noble Transaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28_Book3" id="Page_28_Book3">[Pg 28]</a></span>
its unfit to be remember'd of a
<i>Saint</i> in History. <i>Diogenes Laertius</i> would
have disdain'd to mention such a frivolous
Circumstance in the Life of a Philosopher
as <i>this</i> of <i>Jesus</i>. But if we understand
this <i>Hunger</i> in <i>Jesus</i> mystically, and figuratively
of his Desires of the Fruits of
the Spirit in his Church, it is sublime
and noble; and the Emblem confessedly
proper and instructive.</p>

<p>But <i>Jesus</i> is said to come to the Figtree
at an unseasonable Time; <i>For the
Time of Figs was not yet</i>; which Expression
has been the Perplexity of <i>Commentators</i>,
who with all their Wit and Sagacity
can't get well over it. I shall not
mention here all or any of their pretended
Solutions of this Difficulty; but let us
see whether we can't easily and at once
unlose it. St. <i>Mark</i>'s Words are ου γαρ
ην καιρος συκων, which are and have been
commonly translated, <i>for the Time of Figs
is not yet</i>. But if we change the <i>Point</i>
into an <i>Interrogation</i>, and read thus, <i>for
was it not the Time of Figs?</i> the Difficulty
vanishes as certainly, as that it is absurd
to suppose <i>Christ</i> should come to his Figtree
and look for Fruit, when he could
not reasonably expect any. This my Solution
of this Difficulty certainly serves
the Purpose of the mystical Interpretation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29_Book3" id="Page_29_Book3">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and if it does not the litteral, I answer,
we are not to heed the Letter, which
seldom or never has any Sense or Truth in
it. But, by the by, it does the litteral
too, since there are no Grounds from the
Text to think, what has been the common
Opinion, that it was about the
<i>Jewish</i> Passover that <i>Jesus</i> came to the
Figtree. If this my Solution of the Difficulty
don't please, I must say with<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
<i>Heinsius</i>, that it must be left as a Knot
for <i>Elias</i> to untie, who, according to the<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
ancient <i>Jews</i>, is first to gather Fruits
off this mystical Figtree, and present them
to the intellectual Taste of Mankind. But,
that my Solution is good, will appear by
what follows.</p>

<p>And <i>Jesus</i> finding Leaves only says,
in St. <i>Matthew</i>, to the Figtree, <i>Let no
Fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever</i>;
which (with its parallel Place in St.
<i>Mark</i>) is in my Opinion a false Translation:
The Original is, Μηκετι εκ σου καρπος
γενηται εις τον αιωνα, and ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30_Book3" id="Page_30_Book3">[Pg 30]</a></span>
englished, <i>not as yet</i>, or <i>not until now</i>,
(that I come) <i>against the</i> (grand) <i>Age</i> (of
the Sabbath) has Fruit grown on thee. So
that the Miracle of <i>Jesus</i> was to make
the Figtree of the Church fruitful; and
if her preceding unfruitful State, which
(in St. <i>Mark</i>) <i>Jesus</i> is said to curse, or rather
to devote to Ruin, wasted away, it
was by Consequence.</p>

<p>But what Time of Day was it that
<i>Jesus</i> came to the Figtree? It was in the
<i>Morning</i>. And of what Day? That is uncertain
as to the Letter, but according to
the mystical Extent of the <i>Three Years</i>, whether
we understand the Figtree as a Type
of the Church, or of all Mankind of all
Ages, it will be on the <i>Morning</i> of the
great Sabbath, when, upon the Appearance
of the Light of Christ, like the Rising of
the Sun, an unfruitful and erroneous
Church must needs wither away. And
the Disciples on the said <i>Morning</i> will,
as <i>Origen</i><a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> says, with their intellectual
Eyes behold her waste with Admiration.
And then too, they under Christ
<i>will do what is done to the Figtree</i>, of the
Church, and <i>remove Mountains</i> of Antichristian
Power, that exalt themselves against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31_Book3" id="Page_31_Book3">[Pg 31]</a></span>
him; as the Fathers interpret, and
I need not explain.</p>

<p>And what is meant by the Means, which
St. <i>Luke</i> speaks of, to make the Figtree
of the Church fruitful on the Sabbatical
Year; <i>the Year it is to be let alone to
bear Fruit in</i>? There must be <i>digging about
it</i>, that is<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> into the Earth of the
Letter of the Scriptures, and <i>dunging</i> of
it, that is calling<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> to Remembrance her
Sins and Errors of the Time past, which
rationally speaking will make the Church
to bring forth good Fruit.</p>

<p>After this Fashion is the rest of the Parable
of the Figtree to be allegorized out
of the Fathers. St. <i>Gregory</i><a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> the <i>Great</i>
and St. <i>Augustin</i>, make these two Stories
or Parables, <i>viz.</i> of the Figtree, and of
the Woman with her <i>Spirit of Infirmity</i>,
as they are blended together in St. <i>Luke</i>,
to be Figures of the same Mystery. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32_Book3" id="Page_32_Book3">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<i>eighteen Years</i> of the Woman's Infirmity
and the <i>three Years</i> of the Figtree's Unfruitfulness,
they will have to be mystically
synchronical. And the Woman's <i>Incurvity</i>
to the Earth is, they say, significative
of the same Thing with the <i>Unfruitfulness</i>
of the Figtree. And the <i>Erection</i>
of the Woman on the Sabbath is of
the same Import with the <i>Reservation</i> of
the Tree for Fruitfulness on that Day.
And let any one see, if they don't admirally
agree, as I have interpreted these
two Parables.</p>

<p>Before I dismiss this Story of the Figtree,
I can't but adore the Providence of
God, that the Miracle has been hitherto
placed in the withering away of the Tree.
If the Miracle had been a plain Story of
a dead and wither'd Tree's being made
to bring forth Leaves and Fruit on a sudden;
this would have been such a manifestly
supernatural Work, and so agreeable
to modern Notionists about Miracles,
that Mens Thoughts would have been so
absorpt in the Consideration of the Letter,
as they would never have extended them
to the Contemplation of the Mystery. And
our Divines would have made such a Noise,
in our Ears of the Excellency and Marvellousness
of such a Miracle, as that
there would be no bearing of it. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33_Book3" id="Page_33_Book3">[Pg 33]</a></span>
But as the <i>Evangelists</i> have in a good
Measure suppress'd all mention of the after
Fruitfulness of the Tree; and the Story,
by Misconstruction, is clog'd with the
foresaid Difficulties and Absurdities, we
are of Necessity driven to the search after
Mystery for good Sense and Truth in it.</p>

<p>And thus have I spoken enough to the
Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>'s cursing the Figtree,
which according to the Letter is a foolish
and absurd Story: But the mystical
Operation, of which the Letter is a
Shadow, will be ravishing, marvellous
and stupendous; and not only a Proof
of <i>Christ</i>'s Power, and Presence in his
Church, but a Demonstration of his <i>Messiahship</i>,
in as much as an infinite Number
of Prophecys upon Prophecys, will
thereupon be discern'd to be accomplish'd,
or the Church can't bring forth
the Fruits of the Spirit, that is Spiritual
Interpretations of the Scriptures, like
ripe Figs. And so I pass to an</p>

<p>8. <i>Eighth</i> Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>, and that
is,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> "of his healing a Man of an
Infirmity, of thirty eight Years Duration,
at the Pool of <i>Bethesda</i>, that had
five Porches, in which lay a great Multitude
of impotent Folk, blind, halt,
withered, waiting the troubling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34_Book3" id="Page_34_Book3">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Waters, upon the Descent of an Angel,
who gave a Sanative Virtue to them,
to the curing of any one, be his Distemper
of what kind soever, who first
stept down into them."</p>

<p>This whole Story is what our Saviour
calls a <i>Camel</i> of a monstrous Size for
Absurdities, Improbabilities and Incredibilities,
which our <i>Divines</i>, and their implicit
Followers of these last Ages, have
swallowed without chewing; whilst they
have been straining at <i>Knats</i> in Theology,
and hesitating at frivolous and indifferent
Things of the Church, of no Consequence.</p>

<p>As to <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracle in this Story,
which consisted in his healing a Man, of
no body knows what <i>Infirmity</i>, there neither
is nor can be proved any Thing supernatural
in it, or there had been an
express Description of the Disease, without
which it is impossible to say, there
was a miraculous Cure wrought. As far as
one may reasonably guess, this Man's <i>Infirmity</i>
was more <i>Lazyness</i> than <i>Lameness</i>,
and <i>Jesus</i> only shamed him out of his
pretended Illness, by bidden him to take
up his Stool and walk off, and not lie any
longer, like a lazy Lubbard and Dissembler,
among the Diseased, who were
real Objects of Pity and Compassion: Or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35_Book3" id="Page_35_Book3">[Pg 35]</a></span>
if he was no Dissembler, he was only
fancyfully sick, and <i>Jesus</i> by some proper
and seasonable Talk touch'd his Heart, to
his Relief; and so, by the Help of his own
Imagination, he was cured, and went his
Way. This is the <i>worst</i> that can be
made of this <i>infirm</i> Man's Case; and the
<i>best</i> that can be said of <i>Jesus</i>'s Power
in the Cure of him, as will appear, by and
by, upon Examination into it. But the
other Parts of the Story of the healing
Virtue of the Waters, upon the Descent
of an Angel into them, is not only void
of all good Foundation in History, but
is a Contradiction to common Sense and
Reason, as will be manifest after an Inquiry
into the Particulars of it.</p>

<p>St. <i>John</i> was the beloved Disciple of
our Lord, and I hope he lov'd his Master:
or he was worse than an Heathen, who
loves those who love him: But this Story,
and some others, that are peculiar to his
Gospel, such as, of <i>Jesus's telling the Samaritan
Woman her Fortune</i>; <i>of his healing
the blind Man with Eye-Salve made of
Clay and Spittle</i>; <i>Of his turning Water
into Wine for the Use of Men, who had
before well drank</i>; and of <i>his raising Lazarus
from the Dead</i>, are enough to tempt
us to think, that he wilfully design'd, either
to blast the Reputation of his Master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36_Book3" id="Page_36_Book3">[Pg 36]</a></span>
or to try how far the Credulity of Men
who through blind Love were running apace
into Christianity, might be imposed
on; or he had never related such idle Tales,
which, if the <i>Priesthood</i>, who should be the
philosophical Part of Mankind, had not
been amply hired into the Belief of them,
would certainly have been rejected with
Indignation and Scorn before now.</p>

<p>St. <i>John</i> wrote his Gospel many Years
after the other <i>Evangelists</i>: What then
should have been his peculiar Business?
Certainly nothing more, than to add some
remarkable Passages of Life, to <i>Jesus</i>'s Honour,
which they had omitted; and to confirm
the Truths which they had before reported
of him. But St. <i>John</i> is so far from
doing this, that the Stories, he has particularly
added, are not only derogatory
to the Honour of <i>Jesus</i>, but spoil his
Fame for a Worker of Miracles, which
the other <i>Evangelists</i> would raise him to.
By reading the other <i>Evangelists</i>, one
would think, that <i>Jesus</i> was a Healer of
all manner of Diseases, however incurable
by Art and Nature, and that where-ever
he came, all the sick and the maim'd
(excepting a few Infidels) were perfectly
cured by him. But this Story before us
will be like a Demonstration, that <i>Jesus</i>
was no such Worker of Miracles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37_Book3" id="Page_37_Book3">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Healer of Diseases, as he is commonly
believed to have been; and that he wrought
not near the Number of Cures, he is supposed
to have done, much less any great ones.
The best Conception that an impartial Reader
of the Gospel can form of <i>Jesus</i>, is, that
he was a tolerable good natural <i>Orator</i>, and
could handsomely harangue the People
off hand, and was according to the Philosophy
of the Times, a good <i>Cabalist</i>;
and his Admirers finding him endewed
with the Gift of Utterance, which was
thought by them more than human, they
fancy'd he must have the Gift of healing
too, and would have him to exercise it;
which he did with Success, upon the Fancies
and Imaginations of many, who magnified
his divine Power for it. And the
Apostles afterwards, to help forward the
Credulity and Delusion of the People,
amplified his Fame with extravagant Assertions
and strange Stories of Miracles,
passing the Belief of considerate and wise
Men. Whether this Representation of the
Case, according to the <i>Letter</i> of the Gospels,
be false and improbable, let my
<i>Readers</i> judge by the Story before us,
which I come now to dissect, and make
a particular Examination into the several
Parts of it. Accordingly it is to be observ'd</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38_Book3" id="Page_38_Book3">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p><i>First</i>, that this Story of the <i>Pool</i> of
<i>Bethesda</i>, abstractedly considered from
<i>Jesus</i>'s Cure of an infirm Man at it, has
no good Foundation in History: It merits
no man's Credit, nor will any reasonable
Person give any heed to it. St. <i>John</i> is
the only Author that has made any
mention of this Story; and tho' his Authority
may be good, and better than another
Man's in Relation to the Words
and Actions of <i>Jesus</i>, in as much as he
was most familiar and conversant with
him; yet, for foreign Matters, that have
no immediate Respect to <i>Jesus</i>'s Life, he's
no more to be regarded than another <i>Historian</i>,
who, if he palm upon his <i>Readers</i>
an improbable Tale of senseless and absurd
Circumstances, will have his Authority
questioned, and his Story pry'd into by
the Rules of <i>Criticism</i>, and rejected or
received as it is found worthy of Belief
and Credit. If there had been any
Truth in this Story before us, I cannot
think but <i>Josephus</i> or some other <i>Jewish</i>
Writers, it is so remarkable, peculiar and
astonishing an Instance of the Angelical
Care and Love to the distressed of <i>Jerusalem</i>,
would have spoken of it: But I don't
find they have; or our modern <i>Commentators</i>
would have refer'd to them, as to
Testimony of the Credibility of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39_Book3" id="Page_39_Book3">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Gospel-History. <i>Josephus</i> has professedly
written the History of the <i>Jewish</i>
Nation, in which he seems to omit nothing
that makes for the Honour of his
Country, or for the Manifestation of the
Providence of God over it. He tells us
of the Conversation of Angels with the
Patriarchs and Prophets, and intermixes
Extra-Scriptural Traditions, as he thought
them fit to be transmitted to Posterity.
How came he then and all other <i>Jewish</i>
Writers to forget this Story of the Pool
of <i>Bethesda</i>? I think, we may as well
suppose that a Writer of the natural History
of <i>Somersetshire</i> would neglect to
speak of the medicinal Waters of <i>Bath</i>,
as <i>Josephus</i> should omit that Story, which,
if true, was a singular Proof of God's distinguishing
Care of his peculiar People,
or an Angel had never been frequently,
as we suppose, sent to this Relief of the
Diseased amongst them. Is then St. <i>John</i>'s
single Authority enough to convey this
Story down to us? Some may say, that
there are several Prodigies, as well as political
Events of antient Times, that, tho'
they are reported but by one Historian,
meet with Credit; and why may not St.
<i>John</i>'s Testimony be equal to another
Writer's? I grant it; and tho' it is hardly
probable but that this Story, if true, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40_Book3" id="Page_40_Book3">[Pg 40]</a></span>
us, must have had the Fortune to be told
by others; yet St. <i>John</i>'s single Authority
shall pass sooner than another Man's,
if the Matter be in itself credible and well
circumstanc'd. But where it is blindly imperfectly
and with monstrously incredible
Circumstances related, like this before us,
it ought to be rejected. Which brings me,</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, To ask, what was the true
Occasion of the Angel's Descent into this
Pool? Was it to wash and bath himself?
Or, was it to impart an healing Quality
to the Waters for some one diseased Person?
The Reason, that I ask the first of
these two Questions, is, because some
antient Readings of v. 4. say<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> the
Angel ελουετο <i>was washed</i>, which supposes
some bodily Defilement or Heat contracted
in the C&aelig;lestial Regions, that wanted
Refrigeration or Purgaton in these
Waters: But how absurd such a Thought
is, needs no Proof. To impart then compassionately
an healing Power to the Waters
for the Benefit of the Diseased was
the sole Design of the Angel's Descent into
them. And God forbid, that any should
philosophically debate the Matter, and
enquire how naturally the Waters deriv'd
that Virtue from the Angel's corporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41_Book3" id="Page_41_Book3">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Presence. The Thing was providential
and miraculous, our <i>Divines</i> will say, and
so let it pass. But I may fairly ask, why
one diseased Person only at a Time reap'd
the Benefit? Or why the whole Number
of impotent Folks were not at once healed?
I have a notable Answer presently to be given
to these Questions; but I am afraid beforehand,
our <i>Divines</i> will not approve of
it: Therefore they are to give one of their
own, and make the Matter consistent with
the Goodness and Wisdom of God; or the
said Questions spoil the Credit of the Story,
and make an idle and ridiculous Romance of
it. And when their Hands are in, to make,
what it impossible, a satisfactory Answer
to the said Questions; I wish, that, for the
sake of <i>Orthodoxy</i>, they would determine,
whether the Angel descended with his
Head or his Heels foremost, or whether he
might not come, swauping upon his Breast
into the Waters, like a Goose into a Horse-pond.
But,</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, How often in the Week, the
Month or the Year did the Angel
vouchsafe his Descent into the Pool?
And for how many Ages before <i>Christ</i>'s
Advent, and why not since and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42_Book3" id="Page_42_Book3">[Pg 42]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
<i>now</i>, was this Gracious and Angelical Favour
granted? St. <i>John</i> should have been
Particular as to these Points, which he could
not but know Philosophers would be curious
to enquire about. If it was but once
in the Year, as St. <i>Chrysostom</i><a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> hints,
little Thanks are due to him for his Courtesy.
One would think sometimes, that
his Descent was frequent; or such a Multitude
of impotent Folk, variously disorder'd
had never attended on it. And
again at other Times, one would think
that his Descent was seldom, or the Diseased
as fast as they came, which could
not be faster than the Angel could dabble
himself in the Waters, had been charitably
dismissed with restor'd Health. Here then
is a Defect in St. <i>John</i>'s Story, and a
<i>Block</i>, at which wise and considerate Freethinkers
will stumble. But,</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, How came it to pass, that
there was not better Care taken, either
by the Providence of God, or of the
Civil Magistrates of <i>Jerusalem</i> about
the Disposal of the Angelical Favour to
this or that poor Man, according to his
Necessities or Deserts: But that he, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43_Book3" id="Page_43_Book3">[Pg 43]</a></span>
could fortunately catch the Favour, was
to have it. Just as he who runs fastest
obtains the Prize: So here the Diseased,
who was most nimble and watchful of the
Angel's Descent, and could first plunge
himself into the Pool, carried off the Gift
of Sanation. An odd and a merry Way of
conferring a divine Mercy. And one would
think that the Angels of God did this
for their own Diversion, more than to
do good to Mankind. Just as some throw
a Bone among a Kennel of Hounds, for
the Pleasure of seeing them quarrel for
it; or as others cast a Piece of Money
among a Company of Boys for the Sport
of seeing them scramble for it: So was
the Pastime of the Angels here. It was
the Opinion of some Heathens, that <i>Homines
sunt Lusus Deorum</i>, the Gods
sport themselves with the Miseries of
Mankind; but I never thought, before
I considered this Story, that the Angels
of the God of the <i>Jews</i> did so too.
But if they delighted in it, rare sport
it was to them, as could be to a <i>Town-Mobb</i>.
For as the poor and distressed
Wretches were not to be supposed to
be of such a polite Conversation, as in
Complaisance to give place to their betters,
or in Compassion to make way for
the most miserable; but upon the Sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44_Book3" id="Page_44_Book3">[Pg 44]</a></span>
or Sound of the Angel's Fall into the Pool,
would without Respect of Persons strive
who should be first: So those who were
behind and unlikely to be cured, would
like an unciviliz'd <i>Rabble</i>, push and press
all before them into it. What a Number
then, of some hundreds perhaps, of poor
Creatures were at once tumbled into the
Waters to the Diversion of the City Mob,
as well as of God's Angels? And if one
arose out of it, with the Cure of his Disease,
the rest came forth like drown'd <i>Rats</i>,
to the Laughter of the foresaid Spectators;
and it was well if there was not sometimes
more Mischief done, than the healing
of <i>one</i> could be of Advantage, to those
People. Believe then this Part of the Story,
let him that can. If any Angel was concern'd
in this Work, it was an Angel of
<i>Satan</i> who delights in Mischief; and if
he healed <i>one</i> upon such an Occasion, he
did it by way of Bait, to draw others into
Danger of Life and Limb. But as our <i>Divines</i>
will not, I suppose, bear the Thoughts
of its being a bad Angel; so I leave them
to consider upon our Reasonings, whether
it was credible that either a good or
a bad Angel was concerned, and desire
them to remember to give me a better Reason,
why but <i>one</i> at a Time was healed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45_Book3" id="Page_45_Book3">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>If any Pool or Cistern of Water about
this City of <i>London</i> was so blessed with the
Descent of an Angel to such an End, the
Magistrates, such is their Wisdom, would, if
God did not direct, take care of the prudent
Disposal of the Mercy to the best
Advantage of the Diseased. And if they
sold it to an infirm <i>Lord</i> or <i>Merchant</i>, who
could give for it most Money, to be distributed
among other Poor and distressed People,
would it not be wisely done of them?
To suppose they would leave the Angelick
Favour to the Struggle of a Multitude,
is absurd and incredible. And why then
should we think otherwise of the Magistrates
of <i>Jerusalem</i>? Away then with
the Letter of this Story! And if this be
not enough to confute it. Then,</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, Let us consider, to its farther
Confutation, who and what were the
impotent Folk, that lay in the Porches of
<i>Bethesda</i>, waiting the Troubling of the
Waters. St. <i>John</i> says they were <i>Blind</i>,
<i>Halt</i>, <i>Withered</i>, and as some Manuscripts<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
have it, <i>Paraliticks</i>. And what did
any of these there? How could any of
them be supposed to be nimble enough of
Foot to step down first into the Waters,
and carry off the Prize of Sanation, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46_Book3" id="Page_46_Book3">[Pg 46]</a></span>
many others of various Distempers?
Tho' the troubled Waters might be of
such medicinal Force as to heal a Man of
whatsoever Disease he had; yet none of
the foresaid Persons for want of good Feet
and Eyes could expect the Benefit of it.
Tho' the Ears of the Blind might serve
him to hear, when the Angel plump't
like a Stone into the Waters, yet through
want of Sight for the guidance of his
Steps, he would by others be jostled out
of the right Way down into them. And
if the Lame had good Eyes to discern
the Descent of the Angel, yet Feet were
all in all to this Purpose: Consequently
these impotent Folk, specified by St. <i>John</i>,
might as well have stay'd at Home, as resorted
to <i>Bethesda</i> for Cure. I know not
what Fools the Diseased of <i>Jerusalem</i> of
old might be, but if there was such a Prize
of Health to be strove for, by the Distempered
of this City, I appeal to all Men
of common Sense, whether the <i>Blind</i>, the
<i>Lame</i>, the <i>withered</i> and <i>Paralyticks</i> would
offer to put in for it. St. <i>John</i> then forgot
himself, or else blundered egregiously,
or put the Banter upon us, to try how
far an absurd Tale would pass upon the
World with Credit. There might be, if
there was any litteral Sense in the Story,
many of other Distempers, but there could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47_Book3" id="Page_47_Book3">[Pg 47]</a></span>
be neither <i>blind</i>, <i>halt</i> nor <i>withered</i>, without
<i>such an Absurdity</i>, as absolutely disparages
the Story, blasts the Credit of
the <i>Relator</i>, or rather brings to mind the
Assertion of St. <i>Ambrose</i>, that the Letter
of the <i>New</i> as well as of the <i>Old Testament</i>
lies abominably. If what I have here
said does not overthrow the Letter of this
Story; Then what I have,</p>

<p><i>Sixthly</i>, To add, will do it more effectually,
and that is, of the <i>certain Man, that
had an Infirmity thirty and eight Years</i>, and
lay at this Pool for an Opportunity to be
cured of it. Tho' these <i>thirty</i> and <i>eight</i>
Years are, in our <i>English</i> Translation pr&aelig;dicated
of this Man's Infirmity, yet more
truly, according to the Original, are they
spoken of the Time he lay there? and the
Fathers so understood St. <i>John</i>'s Words.
What this Man's Infirmity was, we are
uncertain: For ασθενεια <i>Weakness</i> or <i>Infirmity</i>
is a general Name of all Distempers, and
may be equally apply'd to one as well as to
another: Whereupon, tho' we can't certainly
say from this Man's Infirmity, that he
was a Fool to lay there so long, expecting
that Cure, which it was impossible for
him to obtain; yet what he says to our
Saviour, <i>I have no Man, when the Waters
are troubled to put me into the Pool, but
while I am coming another steppeth down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48_Book3" id="Page_48_Book3">[Pg 48]</a></span>
before me</i>, does imply his Folly sufficiently,
or rather the Incredibility of the whole
Story. What then did this <i>infirm</i> Man at
this Pool, if he had neither Legs of his
own good enough, nor a Friend to assist
him, in the Attainment of Sanation? Was
he not a Fool, if it was possible for any
to be so great a one, for his Patience?
Would it not have been as wisely done of
him to wait, in the Fields so long, the
Falling of the Sky, that he might catch
Larks? The Fathers say, this Man's <i>Infirmity</i>
was the <i>Palsy</i>; but whether they
said so for the Sake of the Mystery, or to
expose the Letter, I know not. But that
Distemper, after <i>thirty</i> and <i>eight</i> Years
Duration, and Increase; if it was more
curable than another at first, had in that
time undoubtedly so weakened and render'd
him uncapable to struggle with others for
this Relief, that it is without Sense and Reason
to think he should wait so long for
it. Our <i>Divines</i>, if they so please, may
commend this Man for his Patience, but
after a few Years, or rather a few Days
Experience, another Man would have
been convinc'd of the Folly and Vanity
of his Hopes, and returned Home. If
he could not put in for this Benefit, with
Prospect of Success in his more youthful
Days, when the Distemper was young too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49_Book3" id="Page_49_Book3">[Pg 49]</a></span>
much less Reason had he to hope for it
in his old Age, after <i>thirty</i> and <i>eight Years</i>
Affliction, unless he dream'd of, what was
not to be imagin'd, an Opportunity, without
Molestation and Competition, to go
off with it. Whatever then our <i>Divines</i>
may think of this Man and his Patience,
I will not believe there ever was such a
Fool; and for this Reason will not suppose
St. <i>John</i> could literally so romance,
unless he meant to bambouzle
Mankind into the Belief of the greatest
Absurdity. A Man that Lies with a Grace
to deceive others, makes his Story so
hang together, as to carry the Face and
Appearance of Truth along with it;
which this of St. <i>John</i>, that for many
Ages has been swallowed, for the Reason
before us, has not. But what is the worst
of all against this Story is,</p>

<p><i>Seventhly</i>, That which follows, and
absolutely destroys the Fame and Credit
of <i>Jesus</i> for a Worker of Miracles. <i>And</i>
V. 1, 2, 3. <i>Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
where there was by the Sheep-Market, a
Pool, called Bethesda, having five Porches,
in which lay a great Multitude of impotent
Folk, blind, halt, withered.</i> Why
then did not <i>Jesus</i> heal them? Here was
a rare Opportunity for the Display of his
Healing and Almighty Power; and why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50_Book3" id="Page_50_Book3">[Pg 50]</a></span>
did he not exercise it, to the Relief of
that Multitude of impotent Folk? If
he could not cure them, there's an End
of his Power of Miracles? and if he
would not, it was want of Mercy and
Compassion in him. Which way soever
we take this Case, it turns to the Dishonour
of the Holy <i>Jesus</i>. What then was
the Reason, that of so great a Multitude
of diseased People, <i>Jesus</i> exerted his
Power, and extended his Mercy, on only
<i>one</i> poor Paralytick? St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
puts this Question and Objection into
my Mouth; and tho' neither He nor I
start it for the Service of Infidelity, but
to make Way for the Mystery, yet I
know not why <i>Infidels</i> may not make Use
of it, till Ministers of the Letter can give
a satisfactory Answer and Solution to it.</p>

<p>The Evangelists, <i>Matthew</i>, <i>Mark</i>, and
<i>Luke</i>, tell such Stories of <i>Jesus</i>'s healing
Power, as would incline us to think he
cured all where-ever he came. He <i>heal'd</i>,
they say, <i>all Manner</i> of Diseases among
the People, and they make mention of
particular Times and Places, where all
the Diseased were healed by him, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51_Book3" id="Page_51_Book3">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Assertions imply, that <i>Jesus</i>'s healing Power
was most extensive and (excepting to
an hard-hearted and unbelieving <i>Pharisee</i>
now and then) universal; so far that it
might be question'd, whether any died,
during the Time of his Ministry,
the Places where he came: And our
<i>Divines</i> have so harangued on <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles,
as would confirm us in such an
Opinion: But this Story in St. <i>John</i>
confutes and confounds all. St. <i>John</i> in
no Place of his Gospel talks of <i>Jesus</i>'s
healing of many, nor of all manner of
Diseases, much less of all that were Diseased;
which, if it be not like a Contradiction
to the other <i>Evangelists</i>, is some
Diminution of their Authority, and enough
to make us suspect, that they stretch'd much
in praise of their Master, and said more
to his Honour than was strictly true. But
this Place before us is a flat Contradiction
to them, and <i>Jesus</i> is not to be supposed
to heal many in any Place, much
less all manner of Diseases, or he had never
let such a Multitude of poor Wretches
pass without the Exercise of his Power
and Pity on them. Some good Reason
then must be given for <i>Jesus</i>'s Conduct
here, and such a one as will adjust
it to the Reports of the other Evangelists;
or <i>Infidels</i> will think, that either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52_Book3" id="Page_52_Book3">[Pg 52]</a></span>
they romanc'd for the Honour of their
Master, or that St. <i>John</i> in Spite told
this Story to the Degradation of him.
I can conceive no better of this Matter
according to the Letter.</p>

<p>The <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Litchfield</i> very remarkably
says,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> <i>that Jesus where-ever
he went, healed all that came to him without
Distinction, the impotent, halt, withered</i>.
He certainly had this Text of St.
<i>John</i> in his Eye, when he said so, because
<i>Impotent</i>, <i>Halt</i>, <i>Withered</i>, are only mention'd
here, where <i>Jesus</i> cured <i>none</i> of
them: Whereupon if his <i>Lordship</i> had
made but a marginal Reference to this
Text, it would have been the best Jest and
Banter, with a Sneer, that ever was put
upon <i>Jesus</i> and his Power of Miracles:
As it is, it's a very good one, and I
desire my Readers to take Notice of
it, that his Lordship may not lose the
Credit and Praise of it. It's for such Circumspection
of Thought, Exactness of
Expression, and Acuteness of Wit, that
I admire that <i>Prelate</i>, and must needs say
of him, whether he ever be translated to
<i>Canterbury</i> or <i>York</i>, or not, that he's an
<i>arch</i> Bishop.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53_Book3" id="Page_53_Book3">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>But to return and go on. The Conduct
of <i>Jesus</i>, to all Appearance, is not only
blameable, his Power of healing disputable,
and his Mercy indefensible, for that
he cured but <i>one</i> infirm Man out of a Multitude,
at <i>Bethesda</i>, but,</p>

<p><i>Eightly</i>, and lastly, it may reasonably be
questioned, whether he wrought any Miracle
in the healing of this <i>one</i> Man.
Miracles (to say nothing of the ridiculous
Distinction between divine and diabolical
ones) are Works done out of the
Course of Nature, and beyond the Imitation
of human Art or Power. Now
whether the Cure of this infirm Man can
be brought under this Definition of a Miracle,
may be doubted. What this Man's
<i>Infirmity</i>, which is a general Name for
all Distempers, was, we know not. How
then can we say he was miraculously
cured, unless we knew his Disease to be
incurable by Art, which none can affirm?
The worst that we know of this Man's
Case, is, that it was of a long Continuance,
no less than of <i>eight</i> and <i>thirty</i>
Years: And the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Litchfield</i> and
others in their florid Harangues of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Works, make the Cure of such Chronical
Diseases to be miraculous: But why
so? Many Instances may be given of Infirmities
of human Nature, of a long Duration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54_Book3" id="Page_54_Book3">[Pg 54]</a></span>
which in Time, and especially in old
Age, wear off. If such Infirmities don't
occur to the Memory of our <i>Divines</i>, I
could put them in Mind of them. And
who knows but this was the Case of this
impotent Man, whose Infirmity <i>Jesus</i> observing
to be wearing off, bid him to be
gone, and take up his Couch, for he would
soon be made whole.</p>

<p>The Fathers indeed call this Man's Infirmity
the <i>Palsy</i>, which in truth is generally
worse than better by Time, and after
<i>thirty</i> and <i>eight</i> Years, must needs be very
deplorable, and incurable without a Miracle.
But why do they call it the Palsy?
They have no Authority for it from the
Text, without which, as our litteral <i>Doctors</i>
will not subscribe to their Opinions in
other Cases; so why should I here? In
short, the Fathers had never call'd it the
<i>Palsy</i>, but for the sake of the Mystery;
and I am not bound to own <i>that</i> to have
been the Distemper, any more than it was
want of Legs; for that would be making
of Miracles for <i>Jesus</i>, without Reason and
Authority.</p>

<p>If <i>Jesus</i> here had healed the whole
<i>Multitude of impotent Folk</i>; without Enquiry
what Numbers there might be of
them, I should have believed that he
wrought there many great Miracles, in as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55_Book3" id="Page_55_Book3">[Pg 55]</a></span>
much as in such a great Multitude, there
must needs, in all Probability, be some incurable
by Art or Nature: But since he
cured only this <i>one</i> Man, it affords Matter
of Speculation, whether he was the
<i>most</i> or the <i>least</i> diseased amongst them.
Our <i>Divines</i>, for the sake of the Miracle,
may possibly suppose him to be the most
grievously afflicted of any; but <i>Infidels</i>, on
the other hand, will say, not so: but with
their Cavils will urge that this infirm Man
was either a Dissembler, whom <i>Jesus</i>
shamed out of his pretended Disease, or
that he was only hippish, and fancyfully
more than really distemper'd of a long
Time, whom <i>Jesus</i> by suitable Exhortations
and Admonitions, working upon
his Imagination, persuaded into a Belief of
his Cure, and bid him to walk off. Certain
it is, that <i>Infidels</i> will say, it was not
a Power of Miracles in <i>Jesus</i> which heal'd
him, or he had used it then and there for
the Sanation of others also.</p>

<p>And thus have I finish'd my Invective
against the Letter of this Story; which,
if any are offended at, they enjoy, what
is the most reasonable Thing in the World,
the same Liberty to write for the Letter,
which I have used against it: And so I
pass to the Consideration of the Opinions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56_Book3" id="Page_56_Book3">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and Expositions of the Fathers on this
strange Story.</p>

<p>The Fathers, upon whose Authority
I form'd my preceding Invective against
the Letter, so universally betake themselves
to the mystical Interpretation of this
Story, that it may be question'd, whether
any of them, more than myself, believ'd
any Thing at all of the Letter of it. St.
<i>Chrysostom</i>, who is as much a litteral Interpreter
of the Scriptures as any of
them, here intirely discards the Letter,
saying admirably thus,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> <i>what a
strange Way and Story of healing the
Diseased is here? but what is the Mystery
of it? that we are to look to. The Matter
could not be so simply and unadvisedly
transacted litterally, as it is related. There
must be somewhat future here, as by a Type
and Figure, signify'd; or the Story, it is
so incredible in itself, will give Offence to
many.</i> St. <i>Chrysostom</i> was certainly in
the right on't; and I wonder, for which
no Reason but want of Liberty can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57_Book3" id="Page_57_Book3">[Pg 57]</a></span>
given, that <i>Infidels</i> have not before now,
with their Jests and Cavils, ridiculed this
Story. St. <i>Augustin</i>, to the same Purpose,
says,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> <i>Can any one believe, that these
Waters of Bethesda were wont to be
troubled in this Fashion, and that there
was not Mystery, and a spiritual Signification
in it?</i> Yes, I could tell St. <i>Augustin</i>,
that our modern <i>Divines</i> seem to believe it,
tho' he, if he was now alive, would laugh
at them for it. But to come to the profound
Mystery signified by this Story, which to
use the Words of<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> St. <i>Augustin</i>, as
God shall enable me, I will now speak to.</p>

<p>Our <i>English</i> Version says, <i>There is at
Jerusalem by the Sheep-Market, a Pool</i>.
How our <i>Translators</i> came by the Notion
of a <i>Market</i> here, I can't imagine, since
there is nothing to favour it in the Original,
which stands thus, επι τη προβατικη
κολυμβηθρα: By κολυμβηθρα, the
Fathers understand<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Baptism, or the spiritual <i>Laver</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58_Book3" id="Page_58_Book3">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of Regeneration; and who is that for,
but the Flock of Christ, signified by προβατικη? So we have another and clearer
Interpretation of these two Words. And
as to <i>Bethesda</i>, that is a mystical Name
of the Church, which according to the
Signification of <i>Bethesda</i>, is the House
of Grace. And if it is said to be at <i>Jerusalem</i>,
it is not to be understood of the
Old <i>Jerusalem</i>, but of the <i>New</i> and Apocalyptical
<i>Jerusalem</i>, at the Entrance into
which the Flock of Christ will be baptiz'd
by the Waters of the Spirit, as in a mystical
Laver.</p>

<p><i>Bethesda</i> is said to have five <i>Porches</i>,
that is, as the Fathers<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> agree, the five
Books of <i>Moses</i>, which are as so many
Doors of Entrance into the House of Wisdom,
or of the Grace of <i>Christ</i>.</p>

<p>At these <i>five Porches</i> of the five Books
of Moses lay <i>a great Multitude of impotent
Folk, blind, halt, withered</i>. And who
are these mystically? The ignorant, erroneous,
and unstable in Faith and Principle,
as the Fathers often understand them
spiritually. And what is the Reason of
these their mystical Diseases? Because, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59_Book3" id="Page_59_Book3">[Pg 59]</a></span>
St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and other Fathers say,
they rest on the Letter of the Law, which
throws them into various Errors, like
Diseases, of different Kinds, of which
they can't be cured without the Descent
of the Spirit, like an Angel, to instruct
them mystically to interpret.</p>

<p>With these impotent Folk lay <i>a certain
Man who had an Infirmity</i>. And who is
this infirm Man? Mankind in general,
say St. <i>Cyril</i><a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> St. <i>Augustin</i>,
And what is his Infirmity? The Fathers
call it the<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> <i>Palsy</i>, because of his Instability,
and Unsteadiness in Faith and
Principles, which is now the Case of
Mankind. St. <i>John</i> calls it ασθενειαν
<i>a Weakness</i>, which being a general Name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60_Book3" id="Page_60_Book3">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of all Distempers, we can't guess what
might be here the specifical one. But reasonably
speaking, according to the Rule
of Interpretation, this Man's <i>Infirmity</i> is
the same with the Woman's <i>Spirit of Infirmity</i>,
and that is a Weakness at the
Spirit of Prophecy, which Mankind, as
well as the Woman of the Church, is to
be cured of in the Perfection of Time.</p>

<p>And how long did this Man with his
Infirmity lay in these Porches of <i>Bethesda</i>?
<i>Thirty eight Years</i>: So has Mankind with
his Weakness at the Spirit of Prophecy
lay eight and thirty (hundred)<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Years,
reckoning two thousand under the Law,
and eighteen hundred since under the
Gospel. St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> has an ingenious
and more mystical way of Computation
of these <i>thirty and eight Years</i>,
which pleases me too, but possibly some
Readers may not so easily apprehend it,
unless they are well acquainted with the
Mystery of Prophetical Numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61_Book3" id="Page_61_Book3">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>And how is Mankind to be cured of
his Infirmity at the Spirit of Prophecy?
By being instructed, by the Spirit of
Truth, who is to come at the Conclusion
of the said thirty and eight mystical Years,
<i>to arise and take up his bed and walk</i>, that
is, to raise his Thoughts to the Contemplation
of the divine Mysteries of the Law,
and to lift up his Bed of the Letter, on
which he has hitherto <i>rested</i>, into a sublime
Sense, and then he will walk uprightly
and steadily in the Faith, without wavering
like a Paralytick.</p>

<p>And at what Season did <i>Jesus</i> come to
this infirm Man? It was at a Feast of the
<i>Jews</i>. <i>Iren&aelig;us</i>, <i>Chrysostom</i>, <i>Theophylact</i>, and
<i>Cyril</i> call it the Feast of Penticost. And
the grand Feast of Penticost is, as St.
<i>Cyril</i><a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> says upon the Place at the
Perfection of Time, the Time of the Evangelical
Sabbath, and of <i>Jesus</i>'s spiritual
Advent, which will be a Time of feasting
on intellectual and divine Mysteries, of seeing
Visions and of dreaming Dreams; consequently
at that Time, as the ancient <i>Jews</i>
and Fathers assert, Mankind will be cured of
this Infirmity at the Spirit of Prophecy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62_Book3" id="Page_62_Book3">[Pg 62]</a></span>
And this too is the <i>certain Season, that
the Angel will descend and trouble the
Waters</i>. By Angel is here meant<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
the Spirit of Christ. And by Waters the
Fathers understand,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> the People of all
Nations. But how will the Descent of the
Spirit of Truth, like an Angel, trouble
these Waters, that is, give any Molestations
and Disturbance to the People? Is
there not a Mistake in the Oracle? If the
<i>Clergy</i> will be but greater Lovers of Truth
than of their Interests; if they, who
should be Teachers of Forbearance of one
another in Love, will but keep their
Temper, there would be found a mistake
in it. But alas!</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, The <i>Jews</i>, as is intimated,
seem to have been mov'd with Indignation
at the Cure of the infirm Man, saying
to him, ver. 10. <i>it is the Sabbath,
it is not lawful for thee to carry thy
Bed</i>; which litterally could not be true.
The <i>Jews</i> were not such precise Observers
of the Sabbath; nor <i>so stupid and
foolish</i>, as St. <i>Cyril</i>,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> says, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63_Book3" id="Page_63_Book3">[Pg 63]</a></span>
think the taking up and carrying a Stool
to be a Breach of it. But mystically, it
is to be fear'd, this will be most true, and
that the <i>Clergy</i>, who would be <i>Jews</i> inwardly,
and the Circumcision in Spirit,
will be bitter Enemies to Man's Exaltation
of his Couch of the Letter of the
Scriptures on or against the Evangelical
Sabbath, and will make it, if possible, an
<i>unlawful</i> Work; because it will bring to
them Shame, Dishonour and Loss of Interests
along with it.</p>

<p>After this Manner is every other Circumstance
of this Story to be allegorically
apply'd out of the Fathers. The
Moral or Mystery of the whole, in short,
is this, that at the Perfection of Time,
signified by the <i>Sabbath</i>, the <i>Pentecost</i>,
the End of <i>thirty eight Years</i>, the Spirit
of Truth will descend on Mankind, to
their Illumination in Prophecy, and to the
healing of their <i>Errors</i>, call'd <i>Diseases</i>;
which is admirably represented by the
Parable before us, that according to the
Letter, has neither Reason nor common
Sense in it.</p>

<p>And thus have I spoken to <i>eight</i> of the
Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>; and whether I have
not shew'd them, in whole or Part, according
to the Proposition before us, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64_Book3" id="Page_64_Book3">[Pg 64]</a></span>
consist of Absurdities, Improbabilities, and
Incredibilities; and whether they are not
prophetical and parabolical Narratives of
what will be mysteriously, and more wonderfully
done by <i>Jesus</i>, I appeal to my
<i>Readers</i>.</p>

<p>After another Discourse of some other
Miracles, I intend to take into Examination
the several Stories of <i>Jesus</i>'s raising of
the Dead as of <i>Lazarus</i>, <i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter,
and the Widow's Son of <i>Naim</i>; which
reputedly are <i>Jesus</i>'s grand Miracles;
but, for all the seeming Greatness and Excellency
of them, I don't doubt but to give
the Letter of these Stories a Toss out of
the Creed of a considerate and wise Man;
at least show their Insufficiency for the Purpose
for which they have been hitherto
apply'd. And if I should afterwards, by
the Leave and Patience of the <i>Bishop</i> of
<i>London</i>, give my Objection against <i>Christ</i>'s
Resurrection a Review, and some more
Force, then what will become of the Argument
of <i>Christ</i>'s Power, Authority, and
<i>Messiahship</i> from his Miracles?</p>

<p>But, besides <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, I am, as
Opportunity serves, to take into Consideration
some of the Historical Parts of
his Life; and shew them to be no less sensless,
absurd and ridiculous than his Miracles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65_Book3" id="Page_65_Book3">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>And why may I not sometimes treat
on the Parables of <i>Jesus</i>, and show what
nonsensical and absurd Things they are,
according to the Expositions of our most
famous Commentators of these last Ages.
<i>Jesus</i> was certainly the absolute, and most
consummate Perfection of a <i>Cabalist</i>,
<i>Mystist</i>, <i>Parabolist</i> and <i>Enigmatist</i>; but
according to modern Commentaries and
Paraphrases, he was the merest Ideot and
Blockhead that ever open'd his Mouth,
in that sort of Learning, to the Instruction
of Mankind. And I am oblig'd a
little to speak to the Absurdities of <i>Christ</i>'s
Doctrine and Parables, because one Article
of the Prosecution against me was for saying,
<i>that any of the Philosophers of the Gentiles</i>,
or <i>any rational Man</i> (meaning according
to modern Expositions) <i>would make a
better Teacher, than Jesus was</i>.</p>

<p>What a great deal of Work have I upon
my Hands, which, if God spare my
Life and Health, I intend to go on with:
If what I have already done in it be not
acceptable to the <i>Clergy</i>, their Way to prevent
the Prosecution of this great Undertaking,
is to battle me upon what's
past. Who knows but they may write, if
they would try their Strength, so acutely
in Defence of the Letter of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles
already discuss'd, as may effectually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66_Book3" id="Page_66_Book3">[Pg 66]</a></span>
stop my Mouth, and prevent my giving
them any more Trouble of this Kind?
And I suppose I have now gotten an Adversary
in the <i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David</i>'s, who
has already discharg'd one Fool's Bolt at
me.</p>

<p>There has nothing been a more common
Subject of Declamation among the
<i>Clergy</i> than the <i>Reasonableness</i> of Christianity,
which must be understood of the
History of <i>Christ</i>'s Life and Doctrine, or
the Application of the Word <i>Reasonableness</i>
to the Christian Religion is impertinent.
But if I proceed, as I have
begun in this Work, I shall shew Christianity,
as it is understood, to be the most
unreasonable and absurd Story, that ever
was told; and our modern Systems of
Theology groundless and sensless in almost
every Part of them. <i>Mahometanism</i>,
without Offence be it spoken, is a more
<i>reasonable</i> Religion than the Christian, upon
modern <i>Schemes</i> and <i>Systems</i>.</p>

<p>If what I here say is offensive to our
<i>Divines</i>, the <i>Press</i> is open for them as well
as for myself, and they may, if they can,
shew their Resentment of it. Thanks unto
God and our most excellent Civil Government
for such a Liberty of the <i>Press</i>:
A Liberty that will lead and conduct us
to the Fountain of Wisdom and Philosophy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67_Book3" id="Page_67_Book3">[Pg 67]</a></span>
which Restraint is a down-right Enemy
to. And that this Blessing of Liberty
may be continued, for all <i>Bishop Smallbrook</i>
and Dr. <i>Roger</i>'s <i>Hobbism</i>, is, I dare
say, the Desire of the curious, inquisitive,
and philosophical Part of Mankind. If
this Liberty should be taken away, what
a notable Figure will our <i>Divines</i> make
from the <i>Press</i> and <i>Pulpit</i>, declaiming
on the Reasonableness, Excellency and Perfection
of the Christian Religion, without
an Adversary; and telling their Congregations,
that all, their bitterest and acutest
Enemies can object, is clearly answered!</p>

<p>The <i>Press</i>, of late Years, has been productive
of so many cogent and persuasive
Arguments for Liberty of debate, and the
Advocates for this Liberty, in the Judgment
of the impartial and considerate, have
so far gotten the better of their Adversaries,
that I wonder any one can appear in behalf
of Persecution. If I was a <i>Bishop</i> or
<i>Doctor</i> in <i>Divinity</i>, I shou'd think it a
Disgrace to my Station and Education to
ask the Assistance of the Civil Authority to
protect my Religion: I should judge my
self unworthy of the Wages and Emoluments
I enjoy'd, for the Preaching and
Propagation of the Gospel, if I was unable
to give an Answer to any one, that
ask'd a Reason of my Faith; Or if I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68_Book3" id="Page_68_Book3">[Pg 68]</a></span>
so Shallow-pated, as to think Heresy and
Infidelity punishable by the Civil Magistrate,
I should think myself as much oblig'd
to confute by <i>Reason</i>, as he is to punish
by the <i>Sword</i>. If the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i>
had taken this Course with me; if he
had publish'd a Refutation of my supposed
Errors, as well as endeavour'd at a Prosecution
of me for them, I had forgiven him the
Wrongs and Injuries done me, and made
no repeated Demands of Satisfaction for
them.</p>

<p>Christianity is, as I believe, founded on
a Rock of Wisdom; and what's more,
has an omnipotent and omniscient God
on its Side, who can incline the Hearts
of Men to believe, and open the Eyes of
their Understanding to discern the Truth
of it; consequently there can be no Danger
in the Attempts of our Adversaries,
whether, <i>Jews</i>, <i>Turks</i> or Domestick <i>Infidels</i>,
against it. But Persecution implys
Weakness and Impotency in God to defend
his own Cause; or his Priests would not
move for the Help of the Arm of Flesh in
Vindication of it. And if, at this Time
of Day, after so many Treatises of <i>Infidels</i>,
and some of them as yet unanswered,
against our Religion, this good Cause
should be taken out of the Hands of
God, and committed to the Care of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69_Book3" id="Page_69_Book3">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Civil Magistrate; if instead of Reason
the Clergy should have Recourse to Force,
what will By-standers, and even Well-wishers
to Christianity say? Nothing less
than that <i>Infidels</i> had gotten the better of
<i>Christ</i>'s Ministers, and beaten them at
their own Weapons of Reason and Argument.</p>

<p>The two great Pleaders for Persecution,
to the Disgrace of themselves and
Dishonour of our Religion, that have
lately arose are Dr. <i>Rogers</i> and the <i>Bishop</i>
of St. <i>David</i>'s. Dr. <i>Rogers</i>'s chief
Reason against Liberty of Debate, is because,
as he says it is pernicious to the
Peace and Welfare of the Community, by
unsettling the Minds of the People about
the Religion established: But here's no consequence,
unless it could be proved, that
such as the great Mr. <i>Grounds</i> and Mr.
<i>Scheme</i>, have it in their Hearts to raise
Mobbs upon the Government, and to beat
out the Brains of the <i>Clergy</i>. All the
Harm, or rather Good, they aim at, is to
exercise the Wits of the <i>Clergy</i> with their
Doubts and Objections; and if the Passions
of our <i>Ecclesiasticks</i> are not raised upon
it, to the doing of Violence to these
<i>Gentlemen</i>, the Peace of the Publick will
never be disturb'd. As to myself, tho'
I have a vast and numerous Party on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70_Book3" id="Page_70_Book3">[Pg 70]</a></span>
my Side, no less than all the Fathers and
primitive Christians for some Ages; yet
as we were peaceable and quiet Subjects
of old and passively obedient to the <i>Emperors</i>
of <i>Rome</i>; so we will continue to the
Civil Authority of this Nation. We only
take the Liberty to awaken the Clergy
out of a Lethargy of Dulness and Ignorance;
and hope the Civil Magistrate
will consider the Goodness and Charity
of our Intentions, and guard us against
their Insults for it.</p>

<p>The <i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> says,
"It is absurd to assert, that the Liberties
of any Nation will allow, with Impunity,
a Set of distinguish'd Infidels to
insult and treat with the greatest Contempt
and Scorn the most sacred and
important Truths, that are openly professed,
by the whole Body of the People,
of whatever Denomination." By
a Set of Infidels, I suppose, he means me
and the Fathers: And by <i>treating with
Contempt and Scorn the most sacred and important
Truths</i>, he means, our burlesquing,
bantering and ridiculing the <i>Clergy</i> for
their Ministry of the Letter: And for <i>this</i>
he would, I conceive, have incensed the
<i>Societies</i> for Reformation of Manners to a
Prosecution of me. And if they had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71_Book3" id="Page_71_Book3">[Pg 71]</a></span>
been wiser, and more merciful than their
Preacher, I must have gone to Pot. But
why should the <i>Bishop</i> dislike this way of
Writing? Don't he know, that the Fathers
of the Church used to jest and scoff at the
<i>Gentiles</i> and their Priests for their foolish
Superititions? Don't he know, that our
<i>Reformers</i> banter'd and ridicul'd Popery
out of Doors, and almost within the
Memory of Man, it was reckon'd but
a dull Sermon, that was not well
humm'd for its Puns and Jest on the
Papists? why then should the <i>Bishop</i> be against
that way of writing, which was of
good Use to the <i>Reformers</i>, and first <i>Christians</i>?
The grand Subject for <i>Burlesque</i>
and <i>Banter</i>, in my Opinion, is <i>Infidelity</i>;
and that <i>Bishop</i>, who can't break two Jests
upon <i>Infidels</i> for their one upon Christianity,
has but a small Share of Wit. The
Christian Religion according to the <i>Bishop</i>,
will abide the Test of calm and sedate Reasoning
against it, but can't bear a Jest; O
strange!</p>

<p>But to leave these two Contenders for
Persecution to the Chastisement of acuter
Pens. What I have here pleaded for Liberty
is not thro' any Fears of Danger
to myself, but for the Love of Truth and
Advancement of Christianity, which, without
it, can't be defended, propagated and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72_Book3" id="Page_72_Book3">[Pg 72]</a></span>
sincerely embraced. And therefore hope,
that the Controversy before us, between
<i>Infidels</i> and <i>Apostates</i> will be continued by
the Indulgence of the Government, till
Truth arises and shines bright to the Dissipation
of the Mists of Error and Ignorance;
like the Light of the Sun to the Dispersion
of the Darkness of the Night. I will by
God's Leave, go on to bear my part in the
Controversy; And, if it was not more against
the Interests than Reason of the
<i>Clergy</i> to believe me, would again solemnly
declare that what I do in it is with a
View to the Honour of <i>Jesus</i>, our spiritual
<i>Messiah</i>, to whom be Glory for ever.
<i>Amen.</i></p>

<p><i>f the</i> Convocation <i>had

of them, what, for
their Love to the Fathers, they would
readily have granted, a Recommendation
of these my</i> Discourses <i>on</i> Miracles <i>to the</i>
Clergy: <i>But being unhappily disappointed
of a Session of that</i> Reverend <i>and</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv_Book4" id="Page_iv_Book4">[Pg iv]</a></span>
Learned <i>Body, for whose wise Debates

for the Authority of the Fathers,

Difficulties and Discouragements, <i>&amp;c.
That admirable Satire against modern
Orthodoxy and Persecution! How was
I tickled in the Perusal of it! It is
plainly the Sense of your Soul, or you

<p><i>I have sometimes wondered</i>, My
Lord, <i>where and when the Great Mr.</i>
Grounds <i>imbibed his notable Notions
about Religion and Liberty; for he
suck'd them not in with his Mothers
Milk, who, I suppose, train'd him up
in the Belief of Christianity: But when
I consider'd, that he was once the</i> Pupil
<i>of Mr.</i> Hare <i>at</i> Cambridge, <i>my wonder
ceas'd. Under your</i> Lordship<i>'s
Tuition, it seems he laid the Foundation
of his distinguish'd Learning and
Opinions! His Pupillage will be your
immortal Honour! I wonder, none of
the Writers against him have as yet celebrated

you, since there is such a Freedom of
Thought and Expression in your</i> Difficulties,

<p><i>Upon your</i> Lordship'<i>s Advancement

of the Government in the choice of
<i>not withstanding, I
wish'd, without prescribing to the Wisdom
a learned Prelate, that the great Mr.</i>
Grounds, <i>for the good of the Church
too, might be soon consecrated: And I
should not have despair'd of it, but that
he is a</i> Gentleman <i>of real Probity and
Conscience, and might possibly boggle at
Subscriptions, unless you and Bishop</i>
Hoadly <i>could help him to some of your</i>
Reserves <i>and</i> Distinctions, <i>wherewith
you must be both well Stock'd, to overcome
that</i> Difficulty. <i>And why should
not</i> Dean Swift <i>for his Writings, as
well as some others, be made a Bishop?
I should like to see him one; if the</i> then
<i>Right Reverend Bishop</i> Grounds
<i>would not think him, for his</i> Tale of
a Tub, <i>too loose in the Faith, for his
Company</i>.</p>

<p><i>Don't, imagine,</i> My Lord, <i>that I am
forming of Schemes for my self to be a
Bishop. Tho' these my</i> Discourses <i>on</i>
Miracles <i>are of very great Merit, as

<i>&amp;c. yet you may be assured, I have no
such View, when I tell you, that the

<i>of</i> Canterbury, <i>which I'm afraid
will be void, before the King is apprised

<h3>A FOURTH</h3>

<h3>ON THE</h3>
<h1>MIRACLES</h1>

</div>

<p>ow for a <i>fourth</i> Discourse on
<i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, which, as
before, I begin with a Repetition
of the three general
Heads, at first proposed to be
treated on; and they are,</p>

<p>I. To show, that the Miracles of healing
all manner of bodily Diseases, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_Book4" id="Page_2_Book4">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<i>Jesus</i> was famed for, are none of the proper
Miracles of the <i>Messiah</i>; neither are
they so much as a good Proof of his divine
Authority to found a Religion.</p>

<p>II. To prove that the literal History of
many of the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>, as recorded
by the <i>Evangelists</i>, does imply Absurdities,
Improbabilities and Incredibilities;
consequently they, either in the whole
or in part, were never wrought, as it is
commonly believed now-a-days, but are
only related as prophetical and parabolical
Narratives, of what would be mysteriously,
and more wonderfully done by him.</p>

<p>III. To consider what <i>Jesus</i> means,
when he appeals to his Miracles, as to a
Testimony and Witness of his divine
Power; and to show that he could not
properly and ultimately refer to those he
then wrought in the <i>Flesh</i>, but to the mystical
ones, he would do in the Spirit; of
which those wrought in the Flesh are but
mere Types and Shadows.</p>

<p>I am upon the second of these Heads,
and according to it, have, in my <i>former
Discourses</i>, taken into examination <i>eight</i>
of the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>, <i>viz.</i> those:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_Book4" id="Page_3_Book4">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Of his driving the Buyers and Sellers
out of the Temple.</p>

<p>2. Of his exorcising the <i>Devils</i> out of
the Mad-men, and sending them into the
Herd of Swine.</p>

<p>3. Of his Transfiguration on the Mount.</p>

<p>4. Of his Healing a Woman, that had
an Issue of Blood, twelve Years.</p>

<p>5. Of his curing a Woman, that had a
Spirit of Infirmity, eighteen Years.</p>

<p>6. Of his telling the <i>Samaritan</i> Woman,
her fortune of having had five Husbands,
and being than an Adulteress with another
Man.</p>

<p>7. Of his cursing the Fig-tree for not
bearing Fruit out of season. And,</p>

<p>8. Of his healing a Man of an Infirmity
at the Pool of <i>Bethesda</i>.</p>

<p>Whether it be not manifest, that the
Literal and Evangelical Story of these
Miracles, from what I have argu'd and reason'd
upon them, does not consist of Absurdities,
Improbabilities, and Incredibilities,
according to the Proposition before
us, let my Readers judge; and so I come to
the Consideration of</p>

<p>9. A ninth Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>, <i>viz.</i> that<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
of his giving sight to a Man who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_Book4" id="Page_4_Book4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
born blind, by the means of Eve-salve,
made of Dirt and Spittle.</p>

<p>Blindness, as far as one may guess by
the Evangelical History, was the Distemper
that <i>Jesus</i> frequently exercis'd his
Power on: And there is no doubt to be
made, but he heal'd many of one Weakness,
Defect and Imperfection, or other in
their Eyes, but whether he wrought any
Miracle upon any he is supposed to have
cured, is uncertain. There are, as it's notorious,
many kinds of Blindness, that are
incurable by Art or Nature: and there are
other kinds of it, that Nature and Art
will relieve a Man in. But whether <i>Jesus</i>
used his healing Power against the former,
as well as the latter sort of Blindness, is
more than can be affirm'd, or at least proved
by our <i>Divines</i>. And unless we knew of
a certainty, that the sore or blind Eyes,
<i>Jesus</i> cured, were absolutely out of the
reach of Art and Nature; <i>Infidels</i> will
imagine, and suggest, that he was only
Master of a good Ointment for sore Eyes,
and being successful in the use of it, ignorant
People would needs think, he wrought
Miracles.</p>

<p>The World is often bless'd with excellent
<i>Oculists</i>, who thro' Study and Practice
have attain'd to wonderful Skill in
Eye-Maladies, which, tho' they are of various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5_Book4" id="Page_5_Book4">[Pg 5]</a></span>
sorts, yet, by Custom of Speech
all pass under the general Name of <i>Blindness</i>.
And sometimes we hear of famous
<i>Chance-Doctors</i>, like <i>Jesus</i>, who by a Gift
of God, Nature, or Fortune, without any
Skill in the Structure of the Eyes, have
been very successful in the Cure of one
Distemper or other incident to them: Such
was Sir <i>William Read</i>, who, tho' no Scholar,
nor of acquir'd Abilities in <i>Physick</i> and
<i>Surgery</i>, yet cured his Thousands of sore
or blind Eyes; and many of them too to
the surprise and astonishment of profess'd
<i>Surgeons</i> and <i>Physicians</i>. Whether He, or
<i>Jesus</i>, cured the greater number of Blindness
may be question'd. To please our
<i>Divines</i>, it shall be granted that <i>Jesus</i> cured
the greater Numbers; but that he cured
worse or more difficult Distempers in
the Eyes, can't be proved. Sir <i>William</i>
indeed met with many Cases of blind and
sore Eyes, that were out of the reach of
his Power; and so did <i>Jesus</i> too, or he had
never let great Multitudes of the blind, and
otherwise distemper'd People, go unheal'd
by him. Our <i>Divines</i> will here say, that
it was never want of Power in <i>Jesus</i>, but
want of Faith in the diseased, if he did
not heal them; but in other <i>Surgeons</i> and
<i>Physicians</i>, it is confessedly their own
Insufficiency: To which I have only this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6_Book4" id="Page_6_Book4">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Answer, that our <i>Physicians</i> and <i>Surgeons</i>
are to be commended for their Ingenuity,
to impute it to their own Defect of Power,
and not to lay the Blame upon their Patients,
when they can't cure them: And
it is luckly for us Christians, that we have
<i>this Salvo</i> for the Credit of <i>Jesus</i>'s miraculously
healing Power, that it was not
fit, he should exert it against Unbelief;
otherwise reasonably speaking, He with
Sir <i>William Read</i>, <i>Greatrex</i>, <i>Vespasian</i>,
our former <i>Kings</i> of <i>England</i>, and <i>Seventh-Sons</i>,
must have pass'd but for a <i>Chance-Doctor</i>.</p>

<p>But to come to the particular Consideration
of the Miracle before us. <i>Jesus</i> restored,
it seems, a blind Man to his Eye-sight,
by the use of a peculiar Ointment,
and washing of his Eyes, as directed, in
the Pool of <i>Siloam</i>. Where lies the Miracle?
I can't see it; but hope our <i>Divines</i>
will take their opportunity to point
it out to me. Our <i>Surgeons</i>, with their
Ointments and Washings can cure sore
and blind Eyes of one sort or other; and
<i>Jesus</i> did no more here; and yet he must
be reckon'd a Worker of Miracles; and they
but artificial Operators: where's the Sense
and Reason of this difference between
them? If Mr. <i>Moor</i>, the <i>Apothecary</i>, for
the notable Cures he performs, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7_Book4" id="Page_7_Book4">[Pg 7]</a></span>
means of his Medicines, should write himself,
and be accounted by his Admirers, a
<i>Miracle-worker</i>; he and they would be
but laugh'd at for it: And yet <i>Jesus</i> for
his curing the sore Eyes of a poor Man
with an Ointment, must be had in veneration
for a divine and miraculous Operator,
as much as if by the breath of his
Mouth he had removed an huge Mountain!</p>

<p>A Miracle, if I mistake not the Notion
of our <i>Divines</i> about it, is a supernatural
Event, or a Work out of the Power of Nature
or Art to effect. And when it is spoken
of the Cure of a Disease, as of Blindness
or Lameness, it ought to be so represented,
as that skilful and experienced <i>Surgeons</i>
and <i>Physicians</i>, who can do strange
and surprizing Cures by Art, may give it
upon their judgment, that no Skill of
Man could reach that Operation; but that
it ought to pass for the Work of a divine
and almighty Hand and Power. But
there is no such care taken in the Description
of any of the Diseases, which
<i>Jesus</i> cured; much less of this before us;
against the miraculousness of which, consequently,
there are these two Exceptions
to be made:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, that we know nothing of the
Nature of this poor Man's Blindness; nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8_Book4" id="Page_8_Book4">[Pg 8]</a></span>
what was the defect of his Eyes; nor whether
it was curable by Art or not: Without
which Knowledge, it is impossible and
unreasonable to assert, that there was a
Miracle wrought in the Cure of him. If
his blindness or weakness of Eye-sight
was curable by human means, and Jesus
did use those means, there's an end of the
Miracle. If the <i>Evangelist</i> had given us
an accurate Description of the Condition
of this Man's Eyes before Cure, we could
have judg'd better: But this is their constant
neglect in all the Distempers <i>Jesus</i>
heal'd, and is enough to induce us to doubt
of his miraculous Power. There are, as I
have said, some sorts of sore or blind Eyes
curable by Art, as Experience does testify;
and there are others incurable, as <i>Physicians</i>
and <i>Patients</i> do lament. Of which
sort this Man's was, we know not. The
worst that we know of his Case, is, that
he was blind from his Birth, or Infancy,
which might be: and yet Time, Nature
and Art, may give relief to him. As a
Man advances in Years, the diseases of
Childhood and Youth wear off. What we
call the <i>King's-Evil</i>, or an Inflammation in
the Eyes, in time will abate of its Malignity.
Nature will not only by degrees
work the Cure it-self, but the seasonable
help of a good <i>Oculist</i> will soon expedite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9_Book4" id="Page_9_Book4">[Pg 9]</a></span>
it, tho' in time of Infancy he could be of
no use. And who knows but this might
be the Case of this blind Man, whose Cure
<i>Jesus</i> by his Art did only hasten and help
forward. However, there are Grounds
enough to suspect, that it was not divine
Power which heal'd this Man, or <i>Jesus</i>
had never prepared and order'd an <i>Ointment</i>
and <i>Wash</i> for him.</p>

<p>Should our <i>Divines</i> suppose or describe,
for the <i>Evangelist</i>, a state of Blindness in
this Man, incurable by Art; that would
be begging the Question, which no Unbeliever
will grant. But to please them, I
will yield, without Enquiry into the
Nature of this Man's Blindness, that, if
<i>Jesus</i> had used no Medicines; if with only
a word of his Mouth he had cured the
Man, and he had instantaneously recover'd,
as the Word was spoken; here
would have been a real and great Miracle,
let the Blindness or Imperfection of the
Man's Sight before, be of what kind or
degree soever. But <i>Jesus</i>'s use of Washings
and Ointments absolutely spoils and
destroys the Credit of the Miracle, and we
ought by no means to ascribe <i>that</i> to the
immediate Hand and Power of God,
which <i>Medicines</i> and <i>Balsams</i> are apply'd
to the Effect of. And this brings me to
the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10_Book4" id="Page_10_Book4">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second</i> Exception against the miraculousness
of the Cure of this blind Man,
which is, that <i>Jesus</i> used human means
for the Cure of him; which means,
whether they were at all proper and effectual
in themselves, do affect the Credit
of the Miracle, and give occasion of suspicion,
that it was Art and not divine
Power that heal'd him, or <i>Jesus</i>, for
his Honour, had never had recourse to
the use of them. And what were those
Means, or that Medicine, which <i>Jesus</i>
made use of? Why, "He spit upon the
Ground, and made a Balsam of Dirt
and Spittle, and anointed the poor
Man's Eyes with it, and he recover'd."
A strange and odd sort of an Ointment,
that I believe was never used before, nor
since, for sore and blind Eyes! I am
not Student enough in <i>Physick</i> and <i>Surgery</i>
to account for the natural and rational
use of this Balsam; but wish that
skilful Professors of those Sciences would
help me out at this difficulty. If they
could rationally account for the use of
this Eye-salve, tho' it was by supposing,
that Jesus imperceptibly had in his Mouth
a proper unctuous and balsamick Substance,
which he dissolv'd into Spittle,
they would do great service to a certain
Cause; and I wonder none of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11_Book4" id="Page_11_Book4">[Pg 11]</a></span>
whether well or ill affected to Religion,
have as yet bent their Thoughts to it.</p>

<p>In the Practice of <i>Physick</i> and <i>Surgery</i>,
there are sometimes very odd and unaccountable
Medicaments made use of;
and now-and-then very whimsical and
seemingly ridiculous ones, by old Women,
to good Purpose: But none of them are
to be compared to <i>Jesus</i>'s Balsam for
sore Eyes. I have heard of a merry
<i>Mountebank</i> of Distinction, whose catholick
Medicine was <i>Hasty-Pudding</i>,
which indeed is a notable Remedy against
the <i>Esuriency</i> of the Stomach, that the
Poor often labour under. But <i>Jesus</i>'s
Eye-Salve, for absurdity, whim, and incongruity,
was never equall'd, either in
jest or in earnest, by any <i>Quack-Doctor</i>.
Whether <i>Infidels</i> think of this Ointment
of the Holy <i>Jesus</i> with a smile; or reflect
on it with disdain, I can't guess.
As to myself, I should think with St.
<i>Chrysostom</i><a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>, that this Eye-Salve of <i>Jesus</i>
would sooner put a Man's Eyes out,
than restore a blind one to his Sight. And
I believe that our <i>Divines</i>, for the Credit
of the Miracle, and our <i>Surgeons</i>,
for the Honour of their Science, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12_Book4" id="Page_12_Book4">[Pg 12]</a></span>
agree, that it could not be naturally operative
and effective of the Cure of the
blind Man.</p>

<p>What then was the Reason of <i>Jesus</i>'s
using this strange Eye-Salve; when, for
the sake of the Miracle, and for the honour
of his own Power, he should have
cured the Man with a word speaking?
This is a Question and Objection in St.
<i>Cyril</i><a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> against Ministers of the Letter,
who are obliged to give an Answer to it,
that will consist with the Wisdom and
Power of <i>Jesus</i>, otherwise they must
give up the Miracle or make him a
vain, insignificant and trifling Agent. St.
<i>Cyril</i>, of whose mind I am, says<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> that
the Reason of the use of this Balsam
made of Dirt and Spittle is to be fetch'd
from the Mystery. But, in as much as
our <i>Divines</i> will never agree to that,
which would be of ill Consequence to
their Ministry, they must give a good
Reason of their own, which I despair of
seeing, that will comport with the Letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13_Book4" id="Page_13_Book4">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>St. <i>Iren&aelig;us</i> too, says<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>, that the <i>Clay
and Spittle</i> was of no service to the Cure
of the blind Man; and yet <i>Jesus</i> did
not use it <i>in vain</i>. Is not this an Inconsistency?
How will our <i>Divines</i> adjust
it? With <i>Iren&aelig;us</i>, I am sure they'll
not mystically solve the Difficulty; therefore
if they don't provide another Solution
of it to satisfaction; either their Ministry
of the Letter, or the Reputation of
<i>Jesus</i>, and this Miracle must suffer for
it.</p>

<p>I am puzzled to think, how our
<i>Divines</i> will extricate themselves out of
this Strait, and account for the use of
this Eye-Salve, without any Diminution
of the Miracle. Surely, they will not
say that <i>Jesus</i> used this sensless and insignificant
Ointment to put a <i>Slur</i> upon
the Practice of <i>Physick</i> and <i>Surgery</i>, as if
other Medicines were of no more avail
than his <i>Dirt</i> and <i>Spittle</i>. They have
more wit than to say so; least it incense
a noble and most useful Profession,
not so much against themselves, as against
<i>Jesus</i>, and provoke them to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14_Book4" id="Page_14_Book4">[Pg 14]</a></span>
nicer and stricter Enquiry, than I can
make into his Miracles, the Diseases he
cured, and his manner of Operation;
and to infer from thence, that he could
be no miraculous Healer of Diseases who
used Medicines; nor his <i>Evangelists</i> orthodox
at Theology, who were so inexpert
at Anatomy and the Description of
bodily Distempers. This might be of
bad Consequence to Religion: And yet I
wonder that none of them, who may be
supposed a little disaffected to Christianity,
have taken the Hint from this pretended
Miracle before us, and some others, to
endeavour at a Proof of <i>Jesus</i>'s being little
better than a <i>Quack-Doctor</i>.</p>

<p>If I was, what I am not, an <i>Infidel</i>,
I should think, from the Letter of this
Story, that <i>Jesus</i> was a <i>juggling Impostor</i>,
who would pass for a miraculous
Healer of Diseases, tho' he used underhand,
proper Medicines. The <i>Clay and
the Spittle</i> he made an open shew of, as
what, to Admiration, he would cure the
blind Man with; but in reserve he had
a more sanative Balsam, that he subtilly
slip't in the room of the Clay, and repeatedly
to good purpose anointed the
Man's Eyes with it. But as the Authority
of the Fathers, and their mystical
Interpretation of this Story is alone my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15_Book4" id="Page_15_Book4">[Pg 15]</a></span>
safe-guard against such an ill opinion of
<i>Jesus</i>; so I would now gladly know
upon what Bottom the Faith of our
<i>Divines</i> can stand, as to this Miracle, and
<i>Jesus</i>'s divine Power in it.</p>

<p>I have perused some of our <i>Commentators</i>
on the Place, and don't perceive
that they hesitate at this strange Eye-Salve;
nor make any Questions about
the pertinent or impertinent Use of it.
Whether it is, that they sleep over the
Story, or are aware of greater Difficultys
in it, than can be easily surmounted, and
therefore dare not touch on't, I know
not. But now that we enjoy Liberty
of debate, which will make us Philosophers,
and I have taken the Freedom
to make a stricter Scrutiny than ordinary
into <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, and to consider what
Absurditys, their Stories, and <i>this</i> in particular,
are clog'd with; it is incumbent
on our <i>Divines</i> to answer solidly these
Questions, <i>viz.</i> What was the Reason
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Use of this Eye-Salve made
of Clay and Spittle? Whether, if it was
of service to the Cure of the blind Man,
it does not destroy the Miracle? And if
it had no effect in the Cure of him,
whether <i>Jesus</i> was not a <i>vain</i> and <i>trifling</i>
Operator, making use of insignificant and
impertinent Medicines to the Diminution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16_Book4" id="Page_16_Book4">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of his divine Power? There Questions
are not ludicrous, but <i>calm and sedate
Reasoning</i>, which <i>Bishop Smalbroke</i><a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
does not disapprove of. Therefore a grave,
rational, and substantial Answer is expected
to them, such as will be a Vindication
of the Wisdom and Power of
<i>Jesus</i>, without any Diminution of the
Miracle.</p>

<p>Should our <i>Divines</i> say, that this
Matter was an Act of unsearchable
Wisdom and must be left to the Will
of our Saviour, and not curiously pry'd
into, any more than some other Dispensations
of Providence, that are past
finding out: This Answer, which I believe
to be the best, that can be given,
will not do here. The Miracles of
<i>Jesus</i> are, as our <i>Divines</i> own, Appeals
to our Reason and Senses for his Authority;
and by our Reason and Senses they
are to be try'd, condemn'd or approved
of. If they will not abide the test of
Reason and Sense, they are to be rejected,
and <i>Jesus</i>'s Authority along with
them. Therefore a more close, pertinent
and serious Answer is to be given to the
said Questions; which as I believe to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17_Book4" id="Page_17_Book4">[Pg 17]</a></span>
be impossible, consistently with the Letter;
so our <i>Divines</i> must of necessity go
along with me to the Fathers for a mystical
and allegorical Interpretation of the
Story of this Eye-Salve; or the Miracle
will fall to the Ground, and <i>Jesus</i>'s
divine Power be in great danger with
it.</p>

<p>St. <i>Cyril</i>, (who is one of <i>Bishop Smalbroke</i>'s
Greek Commentators, that should
strictly adhere to the Letter) signifies, as
I before observ'd, that <i>Jesus</i>'s Use of this
Clay and Spittle would be an Absurdity,
if it was not to be accounted for, from the
Mystery.</p>

<p><i>Eusebius Gallicanus</i>, treating on this
Miracle, says<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>; "that our Saviour
apparently manifests that his Miracles
are of a spiritual and mystical Signification,
because in the Work of them,
he does somewhat or other, that literally
has no Sense nor Reason in it.
As for Instance, in the Cure of this
blind Man, what occasion was there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18_Book4" id="Page_18_Book4">[Pg 18]</a></span>
for <i>Clay and Spittle</i> to anoint his Eyes,
if it was not of a mystical meaning,
when with a Word of his Mouth,
<i>Jesus</i> could have cured him? Let us
then set aside the Letter of the Story,
and Search for the Mystery, and consider
who is meant by this Blind
Man, <i>&amp;c.</i>"</p>

<p><i>Origen</i> too, upon occasion of this
Miracle, and its Absurdity according to
the Letter, says<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>; "that whatever
<i>Jesus</i> did in the Flesh was but a Type
and Figure of what he would do in
Spirit, as is apparent from the Miracle
of his curing a blind Man, which nobody
knows why it was so done, if
it be not to be understood of a mystical
Ointment to open the Eyes of the
blind in Understanding."</p>

<p>And who then is this blind Man mystically?

be cured of this Blindness in Understanding.</p>

<p>And what is Mankind's Blindness here
signified? St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>, St. <i>Cyril</i><a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>

(Still <i>Bishop Smalbroke</i>'s literal
and Greek Commentators!) tell us
the Reason of this spiritual Blindness of
Mankind, that is, because they adhere to
the Letter of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>And how will <i>Jesus</i>, or right <i>Reason</i>
and <i>Truth</i>, which are his mystical Names,
cure Mankind of this his spiritual Blindness?
By his mystical <i>Spittle</i> temper'd
with mystical <i>Dirt</i>. And how shall
we do to understand this mystical Ointment,
so as to make it a proper Medicine
for Mankind's spiritual Blindness?
St. <i>Theophilus</i> of <i>Antioch</i><a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>, has an
allegorical Interpretation of this <i>Clay</i> and
<i>Spittle</i> of our Lord; but as it is hard to
apprehend his meaning, I shall not here
insist on it. <i>Origen</i> says<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>, that the
anointing of the blind Man's Eyes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21_Book4" id="Page_21_Book4">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<i>Spittle</i>, is to be understood of the Unction
of the <i>Spirit</i> of Christ. But this
does not give us rightly to understand
the Metaphor and Figure. St. <i>John</i> of
<i>Jerusalem</i> says, that by the <i>Clay</i> and <i>Spittle</i>
is meant<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> <i>perfect Doctrine</i>, which
in Truth may open the Eyes of Mens
Understanding: But what is <i>perfect Doctrine</i>?
Why, to help the Fathers out here,
without departing from their Opinions,
by the <i>Spittle</i> of Jesus must be understood
the <i>Water</i> of the Spirit instill'd into
the <i>Earth</i> of the Letter of the Scriptures,
which temper'd together, does, in the
Judgment of them all, make <i>perfect Doctrine</i>
to the opening of the Eyes of our
Understanding in the Knowledge of the
Providence of God of all Ages; which
Knowledge, Light, Sight, or Illumination,
Mankind has hitherto wanted.</p>

<p>St. <i>Iren&aelig;us</i><a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>, gives an excellent and
mystical Reason, by himself, for the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22_Book4" id="Page_22_Book4">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of this Ointment of <i>Clay</i> and <i>Spittle</i>, to
the Cure of this blind Man, which I shall
not stay to illustrate, but only have cited it
for the Meditation of the Learned and
Curious.</p>

<p>The Story of the blind Man, as St.
<i>John</i> has related it, is long, and would
take up more time, than I have to spare
at present, to go thro' all the Parts of it.
What I have done at present is enough to
awaken others to the Consideration, not
only of the Absurdities of the Letter,
but of the mystical Interpretation of the
rest.</p>

<p>The Miracle, which consisted literally
in the Cure of a blind Man by the use of
an Ointment made of <i>Dirt</i> and <i>Spittle</i>, is
absurd, sensless and unaccountable; but in
the Mystery, there is Wisdom and Reason.
And the Cure of Mankind of the Blindness
of his Understanding, by the <i>Spirit</i>'s
being temper'd with the <i>Letter</i> of the
Scriptures, which is the mystical <i>Eye-Salve</i>,
will not only be a most stupendous Miracle,
but a Proof of <i>Jesus</i>'s <i>Messiahship</i> beyond
all contradiction, in as much as by such
an opening of the Eyes of our Understandings,
which have been hitherto dark, we
shall see, how he is the Accomplishment
of the Law and the Prophets. And so I
pass to a</p>

<p>10. Tenth Miracle of Jesus, <i>viz.</i><a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
<i>That of his turning Water into Wine, at
a Marriage in</i> Cana <i>of</i> Galilee. This
is call'd the beginning of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles;
but whether it is to be understood
of the <i>First</i> of his whole Life, or of the
<i>First</i> that he wrought in <i>Cana</i> of <i>Galilee</i>,
is not agreed amongst <i>Divines</i>. I shall
not enter into the Dispute, which as it
is of no Consequence to my Cause in
hand; so I shall pass it by, and not
urge any Arguments for or against either
side of it.</p>

<p>Tho' I would not for the World be
so impious and profane as to believe,
what is contain'd and imply'd in the
Letter of this Story; yet I am still too
grave to handle it as ludicrously as I
ought; and it is now against the grain,
that I write so freely, as I shall against
it, being unwilling, not only to put the
<i>Clergy</i> out of all Temper, but, to give
<i>Scoffers</i> and <i>Infidels</i> so great an Advantage
against their Ministry of the Letter.
Some may wonder that I, who have
gone so far in the ludicrous display of
the gross Absurdities of some other Miracles,
should boggle at this. But to be
ingenuous, and speak the Truth sincerely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24_Book4" id="Page_24_Book4">[Pg 24]</a></span>
I am still a Christian (for all what
the <i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David</i>'s,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> <i>Archdeacon
Stubbs</i>, and others would make of
me) upon the Principles of the Fathers,
and have a greater Veneration for the
Person of the Holy <i>Jesus</i>, than to be forward
to make such sport with him, his Mother,
and his Disciples, as this Story affords
Scope for. And if it was not for the necessity
of turning the <i>Clergy</i>'s Heads to the Consideration
of Mysteries; this Miracle should
have been pass'd by in silence.</p>

<p>There were some antiently, whom St.
<i>Chrysostom</i><a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> writes of, whether <i>Jews</i>,
<i>Gentiles</i>, or <i>Hereticks</i>, I know not, who
took great offence at the Story of this
Wedding, accounting it, from what is related
in St. <i>John</i>, as a riotous Feast,
and that <i>Jesus</i> and his Mother, and his
Disciples, not only bore a part in the
Revellings, but were most to blame for
them, or he should not have countenanced
them with his Presence, much less promoted
them, by the Change of a large
quantity of Water into Wine for the use
of a Company, who were already <i>drunk</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25_Book4" id="Page_25_Book4">[Pg 25]</a></span>
with it. But I, with St. <i>Chrysostom</i>, am
inclined to believe, that, if <i>Jesus</i> did
grace this Wedding with his Presence,
there was no Excess encouraged, or so
much as suffer'd at it. If he did accept
of the Invitation of the Bridegroom, it
was for an Opportunity, not so much to
turn <i>Water</i> into <i>Wine</i>, as to make a proper
Discourse to the People of conjugal
Duties; and, as he was a Searcher of the
Hearts, secretly to admonish the Married
of the Sin and Mischief of Adultery;
tho' we read not of a seasonable and
good Word spoken at it.</p>

<p>And the Empress <i>Eudocia</i>, a nursing
Mother of the Church, has given us a
Poetical, and I hope a fictitious Description
of this Wedding. She makes a
sumptuous and voluptuous Feast of it;
and writes<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> of <i>Musick</i> and <i>Dancing</i>
in abundance, enough to make us think
of such Mirth and Pastime here, as was
unbecoming of a Company of Saints to
be present at. Whether it was, that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26_Book4" id="Page_26_Book4">[Pg 26]</a></span>
<i>Empress</i>, being only accustom'd to the
Excesses of a Court, could form no meaner
Conceptions of a Country Wedding;
or whether she had any extra-scriptural
Authority for what she writ, I know
not: But I believe, that, if <i>Jesus</i> was at
all at a Marriage-Feast, the whole was
conducted with Decency, Order, and Sobriety;
and if he there wrought any
Miracle, it was to manifest his Glory,
to the Conversion of some, and Confirmation
of the Faith of others.</p>

<p>And our <i>Translators</i> of the <i>Bible</i> too
have given occasion to suspect somewhat
of Excess at this Wedding; or
they need not have made the Waterpots
to hold two or three Firkins apiece. If
I had been the Translator, they should
not have held above two or three <i>Pints</i>
apiece, which Measure is as agreeable to
the Original as <i>Firkin</i>; neither can I
imagine, that <i>Jesus</i>, if he did convert
Water into Wine, would do it in so
large a Measure, for fear of an intemperate
abuse of it, but only gave the Company
a cast of his miraculous Power,
and a little Taste of his Love and Good-will
to them.</p>

<p>Such are the Conceptions, that, to the
Honour of <i>Jesus</i>, I am willing to form
of this <i>Wedding</i>; and wish that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27_Book4" id="Page_27_Book4">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Letter of the Story did suggest no worse
Thoughts of it to us. I should be pleas'd,
if no <i>Infidel</i> really could, what I, but
for the sake of the Mystery most unwillingly
should, write any ludicrous
Descants on it. But if this Story had
been related of <i>Apollonius Tyran&aelig;us</i>, as
it is of our <i>Jesus</i>, I would have ridicul'd
and satiriz'd it to the utmost of
my Power, and have render'd him and
his Disciples of all Nations, as contemptible
as I could, for the Belief of it;
and I don't doubt, but our Christian
<i>Priests</i> would have given me ample Praises
and Commendations for so doing. It
is said of <i>Apollonius</i>, that for the Entertainment
of his Friends, he commanded
variety of nice Dishes of Meat, together
with Bowls of choicest Wines, all on a
sudden to descend upon his Table and
range themselves in good Order. Whether
there was any Truth in this Miracle
of <i>Apollonius</i>, is not the Question;
but Mr. <i>Chandler</i><a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> could see a Fault
in it, (tho' none in <i>Jesus</i>'s Wine at this
Wedding) as if it was done for the Pleasure
of luxurious Appetites, tho' we read
of no Intemperance at it, which can't be
said of the <i>Wedding-Feast</i> before us. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28_Book4" id="Page_28_Book4">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<i>Divines</i> I suppose, no more than myself,
believe any thing of the said Miracle in
<i>Apollonius</i>; but, if it was really wrought,
I fancy, I could have lampoon'd him for
it, and would have made it a diabolical
Work, like that, as Fables go, of the
Feastings of <i>Wizards</i> and <i>Witches</i>; and
our <i>Divines</i> (passing by <i>Jesus</i>'s <i>Wine</i>
here) would readily, as they are Believers
of the Storys of Witchcraft, have
struck in with me.</p>

<p>But setting aside that miraculous Story
of <i>Apollonius</i>, which has but <i>one</i> Voucher;
the Case before us is <i>Jesus</i>'s <i>turning Water
into Wine</i> for the use of Men, who
had before <i>well drank</i>. How shall I
force Nature and Faith to ridicule this
Story? How shall I lay aside that profound
Veneration for the Holy <i>Jesus</i>,
which Conversation with the Fathers,
more than the Prejudice of Education
has begotten in me, and ludicrously here
treat him and his Miracle too, as is incumbent
upon me, to make way for the
Mystery? In short, I can't do it, in my
own Name; but having met with a satirical
Invective of a supposed Jewish <i>Rabbi</i>
to this purpose, I here publish it, that
our <i>Clergy</i>, as well as myself, may
think of an Answer to it, and so prevent
that Mischief it may do by being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29_Book4" id="Page_29_Book4">[Pg 29]</a></span>
handed about among <i>Jews</i> and <i>Infidels</i>,
in Manuscript. It is as follows;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You Christians pay Adoration to
<i>Jesus</i>, whom you believe to be a divine
Author of Religion, sent of God
for the Instruction, Reformation and
Salvation of Mankind, and what induces
you to this Belief of him, is,
(besides some obscure Prophecies, which
you can't agree upon, and which neither
your selves, nor any body else
understands the Application of) the
History of his Miracles: But I wonder,
you should have a good opinion
of him for his Miracles, which, if he
wrought no better than what are recorded
of him, by your <i>Evangelists</i>,
are, if duly consider'd, enough to alienate
your Hearts from him. I can't
spare time now to examine into all of
them, but according to the cursory
Observation I have made on them, there
is not one so well circumstanced, as to
merit a considerate Man's belief, that
it was the Work of an omnipotent,
all-wise, just and good Agent. Some
of them are absurd Tales, others foolish
Facts, others unjust Actions, others
ludicrous Pranks, others jugling Tricks,
others magical Enchantments; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30_Book4" id="Page_30_Book4">[Pg 30]</a></span>
many of them had been better and
greater Operations than they are, and
of a more useful and stupendous Nature
than they seem to be; yet the
first Miracle that he wrought, <i>viz.</i>
that of his <i>turning Water into Wine</i>
at an extravagant and voluptuous Wedding
at <i>Cana</i> of <i>Galilee</i>, is enough to
turn our Stomachs against all the rest.
It is in itself enough to beget in us
an ill opinion of <i>Jesus</i>, and to prepossess
us with an aversion to his Religion,
without farther Examination into it.
It is enough to make us suspect his other
Miracles, of what Name soever,
to be of a base, magical, and diabolical
Extraction; or he had never set
up for a divine worker of Miracles
with so ill a grace. Would any sober,
grave, serious and divine Person,
as you Christians suppose <i>Jesus</i> to have
been, have vouchsafed his Presence at
a Wedding; where such Levities, Diversions
and Excesses (in our Nation of
the <i>Jews</i>, as well as in all others)
were indulg'd on such Occasions, as
were not fit to be seen, much less
countenanc'd by the <i>Saint</i>, you would
make of him. If your <i>Jesus</i>, his Mother,
and his Disciples had not been
merry Folks in themselves, they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31_Book4" id="Page_31_Book4">[Pg 31]</a></span>
have declined the Invitation of the
<i>Bridegroom</i>; nay, it they had been at
all graver and more serious People
than ordinary, no Invitation had been
given to such <i>Spoil-Sports</i>: But boon
Companions they were, and of comical
Conversation, or there had been
at a Wedding no Room for them. You
Christians may fancy, what you please,
of <i>Jesus</i> and his Mother's Saintship;
but the very Text of the Story implies,
they were Lovers of good Fellowship
and Excess too, upon occasion;
or he had never, upon her Intimation,
turn'd so large a quantity of
Water into Wine, after all or most of
the Company were far gone with it.
You may suppose, if you please, that
all were sober, and none intoxicated,
and that the Want of Wine proceeded
from the abundance of Company,
rather than excess in drinking;
but why then did <i>John</i> the <i>Evangelist</i>
use the word μεθυσθασι, which
implies, they were more than half Seas
over? And if <i>Jesus</i> and his Mother
had not both a mind to <i>top</i> them up;
the one would not have requested, nor
the other have granted a Miracle to
that purpose. Whether <i>Jesus</i> and his
Mother themselves were at all <i>cut</i>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32_Book4" id="Page_32_Book4">[Pg 32]</a></span>
were others of the Company, is not
so certain. She might be an abstemious
Dame for ought we know; tho' if
old Stories are true of her familiarity
with a <i>Soldier</i>, of whom came her
<i>chara Deûm Soboles</i>, in all probability
she would take a <i>Dram</i> and a <i>Bottle</i>
too. But it looks as if <i>Jesus</i> himself
was a little <i>in</i> for't, or he had
never spoke so waspishly and snappishly
to his Mother, saying, <i>Woman,
what have I to do with thee</i>? <i>mine
Hour is not yet come</i>: which was very
unbecoming of a dutiful Son, who,
excepting when he ran away from
his Parents, and put them to<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
<i>Sorrow</i> and <i>Trouble</i> to look him up,
was, and is still in Heaven, say the
<i>Roman Catholicks</i> a most obedient Child.
You modern Christians may put what
Construction you can upon the words
above of <i>Jesus</i> to his Mother, to salve
his Credit; but the Fathers of your
Church<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> confess them to be a sharp
and surly Reply to her, which, if it
did not proceed from the natural badness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33_Book4" id="Page_33_Book4">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of his Temper, derived, <i>ex traduce</i>,
from his supposed Father yet, was certainly
the effect of Drinking, and
that's the more likely, because it is
a <i>broken</i> and <i>witless</i> Sentence, such as
<i>Fuddlecaps</i> utter by halves, when the
<i>Wine's in</i>, and the <i>Wit's out</i>. Your
modern <i>Commentators</i> are sadly puzzled
to make good Sense of this broken
and abrupt Sentence of <i>Jesus</i>, and
a pertinent Reply of it, to what his
Mother said to him, <i>they have no
Wine</i>: If you will bear with me, I'll
help you out at this dead lift, and
give you the true meaning of it <i>thus</i>.
<i>Jesus</i>'s Mother being apprised of a
deficiency of Wine, and willing, as well
as the <i>Bridegroom</i>, that the Company
should be thorowly merry before they
parted, intimates to her Son, (whom
she knew to be initiated in the Mysterys
of <i>Bacchus</i>) <i>that they had no
Wine</i>: But before she could finish her
Request to him, He, mistaking her
meaning, imagines, she was cautioning
against drinking more Wine, and
exhorting him to go home; whereupon
he takes her up short and quick,
saying, <i>Woman, what have you to do
with me?</i> (for that too is the <i>English</i>
of the <i>Greek</i>) I'll not be interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34_Book4" id="Page_34_Book4">[Pg 34]</a></span>
in my Cups, nor break Company;
<i>for mine Hour is not yet come</i> to depart:
But after he rightly apprehended
her, he goes to work, and rather
than the Company should want their
fill, by trick of Art, like a <i>Punch-maker</i>,
meliorates Water into what they
call'd Wine. That this is the obvious
Interpretation, and natural Paraphrase
of the Words before us, shall be try'd
by the Absurd Comments now-a-days
put upon them, that are enough to
make a considerate Man laugh, if not
hiss at them.</p>

<p>"Some antient Hereticks<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>, very
gravely inferr'd from this Expression,
<i>Woman, what have I to do with thee</i>,
that <i>Mary</i> was neither a Virgin, nor
<i>Jesus</i> her Son; or he had never accosted
her with such blunt Language,
that implys, they could not be so akin
to each other. This was a perplexity
to St. <i>Augustin</i>, and gave him
some trouble to explain the Expression,
consistently with her Virginity
(for all she cohabited with the old Carpenter)
and his Filiation. But this
being a quibble, that has been long
since dropt, I shall not revive, nor insist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35_Book4" id="Page_35_Book4">[Pg 35]</a></span>
on it. But that the Expression
above do's suppose a little Inebriation,
in <i>Jesus</i>, I may avert, neither is
there a better Solution to be made of
it.</p>

<p>"The Fathers of your Church, being
sensible of the absurdity, abruptness,
impertinence, pertness, and senslesness
of the Passage before us according
to the Letter, had recourse to
a mystical and allegorical Interpretation,
as the only way to make it consistent
with the Wisdom, Sobriety and
Duty of the Holy <i>Jesus</i>. But you
<i>Moderns</i>, abandoning Allegories and
Mysteries on Miracles, have endeavour'd,
I say, to put other Constructions
upon it, as may comport with
the Letter and Credit of Jesus: But
how insipid and sensless they are,
I appeal to a reasonable Man, who
will give himself the trouble to consult
them, upon the Place, and save
me the Pains of a tedious and nauseous
Work to recount them for him.</p>

<p>"But to Humour the Christian Priesthood
at this Day, I will suppose that
<i>Jesus</i>, and his Mother, and Disciples,
tho' Fishermen, to have been all sober,
grave and serious at this Wedding,
suitably to the Opinion that their Followers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36_Book4" id="Page_36_Book4">[Pg 36]</a></span>
now would have us to entertain
of them. But then it is hard
to conceive them, less than Spectators
and even Encouragers of Excess and
Intemperance in others; or <i>Jesus</i>, after
their more than sufficient drinking
for the satisfaction of Nature,
had never turn'd Water into Wine,
nor would his Mother have requested
him to do it, if, I say, they had not
a mind, and took Pleasure in it too, to
see the Company quite <i>stitch'd up</i>.</p>

<p>"A sober, prudent and wise Philosopher
or <i>Magician</i>, in the place of
<i>Jesus</i>, if he had an Art or Power to
turn Water into Wine, would never
have exercised it upon such an occasion;
no, not to please his best Friends,
nor in obedience to the most indulgent
Parent. What would he have
said in such a Case? That the Company
had drank sufficiently already,
and there was no need of more Wine:
The Bridegroom had kindly and plentifully
entertain'd his Guests, and he
would not for the Honour of God,
who had endow'd him with a divine
Power, be at the Expence of a Miracle
to promote the least Intemperance.
Whether such a Speech and Resolution
in <i>Jesus</i>, upon this occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37_Book4" id="Page_37_Book4">[Pg 37]</a></span>
would not have been more commendable,
than what he did, let any one
judge.</p>

<p>"If I was a Christian, I would, for
the Honour of <i>Jesus</i>, renounce this
Miracle, and not magnify and extol
it as a divine and good Act, as many
now-a-days do. I would give into,
and contend for the Truth of <i>that
Gloss</i>, which the <i>Gentiles</i> of old<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
by way of Objection put upon it,
<i>viz. That the Company having exhausted
the Bridegroom's Stock of Wine,
and being in Expectation of more</i>;
Jesus, <i>rather than the Bridegroom should
be put to the Blush for deficiency,
palm'd a false Miracle, by the help
of the Governour of the Feast, upon
a drunken Crew; that is, having some
spirituous Liquors at hand, mingled
them with a quantity of Water, which
the Governour of the Feast vouch'd
to be incomparable good Wine, miraculously
made by</i> Jesus: <i>and the Company
being, thro' a vitiated Palate,
uncapable of distinguishing better from
worse, and of discovering the Fraud,
admired the Wine and the Miracle;
and applauded</i> Jesus <i>for it, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38_Book4" id="Page_38_Book4">[Pg 38]</a></span>
became his Disciples upon it</i>. If
I, I say, was a Disciple of <i>Jesus</i>, I
would give this Story such an old
turn for his Credit. And I appeal
to indifferent Judges, whether such a
daubing of the Miracle, to remove the
Offence of <i>Infidels</i> at this Day, would
not be politically and wisely done of
me. Whether modern Christians may
be brought into such a Notion of
this supposed Miracle, I know not;
but really there is room enough to
suspect such a Fraud in it.</p>

<p>"But supposing <i>Jesus</i>'s Change of
Water into Wine to have been a real
Miracle; none commission'd of God
for the Reformation and Instruction
of Mankind would ever have done it
here. Miracles (as Mr. <i>Chandler</i><a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
says excellently well) <i>must be such
things, as that it is consistent with
the Perfections of God, to interest
himself in</i>; and again, <i>they must argue
not only the Power of God, but
his Love to Mankind, and his Inclination
to do them good</i>; which this of
<i>Jesus</i> is so far from, that it has an
evil Aspect and Tendency, as is
above represented; consequently it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39_Book4" id="Page_39_Book4">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to be rejected, and no longer esteem'd
a divine Miracle; neither is <i>Jesus</i> to
be received as a Revealer of God's
Will for it, as Mr. <i>Chandler</i> will
bear me witness.</p>

<p>"No doubt on't, but you Christian
Priests would have us <i>Jews</i> and <i>Infidels</i>,
to believe the whole Company
at this Wedding, for all what
is intimated by St. <i>John</i> to the contrary,
to consist of sober and demure
Saints. I will suppose so; but then,
what occasion had they at all for
Wine? What reason could there be
for God's Power to interpose and make
it, especially in so large a quantity,
for them? I can conceive none. If
any of the Company had been taken
with fainting Fits; and <i>Jesus</i> for
want of a Cordial Bottle, had created
a chearing Drain or two, I could not
have found fault with it; tho' even
here, if he had restored the <i>Patient</i>
with a word of his Mouth, it had
been a better Miracle, than making
of Wine for him: But that he should
make for a Company of Sots, a large
quantity of Wine, of no less than
twelve or eighteen Firkins of <i>English</i>
Measure, enough to intoxicate the
whole Town of <i>Cana</i> of <i>Galilee</i>, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40_Book4" id="Page_40_Book4">[Pg 40]</a></span>
what can never be accounted for by
a Christian, who should, one would
think, wish this Story, for the Reputation
of <i>Jesus</i> expunged out of the
New Testament.</p>

<p>"Besides, if <i>Jesus</i> had really and miraculously
made Wine, which no Power
or Art of Man could do, he should,
to prevent all suspicion of deceit in
the Miracle, have done it without
the use of Water. You Christians say,
he is the original Cause of all Things
out of nothing; why then did he
not<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> create this Wine out of
nothing? why did he not order the
Pots to be emptied of their Water,
if there was any in them, and then
with a word of his Mouth command
the filling them with Wine instead of
it? Here had been an unexceptionable
Miracle, which no <i>Infidels</i> could
have cavil'd at, for any thing, but the
<i>needlessness</i> of it. But this subject
Matter of Water spoils the Credit of
the Miracle. The Water-Pots, it seems,
are to be fill'd, before <i>Jesus</i> could do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41_Book4" id="Page_41_Book4">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the notable Feat; is not this enough
to make us think, that Jesus was but
an artificial <i>Punch-maker</i>? Could not
he create Wine without Water for a
Transmutation? Yes, you'll say he
could: what was the Reason then, that
he did not? This is a reasonable Question
to a learned Priesthood: and a rational
Answer should be given to
it. And a Question too it is that
heretofore has been under debate.
Some said that the Water might be
used to abate of the<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> immensity
of the Miracle, which otherwise for
its greatness might have surpass'd all
Belief. But this Reason will not do.
A Miracle can't be too great in itself,
if well attested, to transcend Credit:
but it may easily be too little to conciliate
the Faith of a Free-Thinker.
The Fathers of your Church fetch'd a
Reason, for the use of Water here,
from the Mystery; but since Mysterys
on Miracles are set aside by the Priesthood
of this Age, they are to assign
another and good Reason of their own;
or this Miracle is to be rejected, as a
Piece of Art and Craft in the Operator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42_Book4" id="Page_42_Book4">[Pg 42]</a></span>
if for no other Reason than this,
that <i>Jesus</i> used Water to make Wine.</p>

<p>"All that I have to say more to this
Miracle, is, that it is to be wish'd, if
Jesus could turn Water into Wine, that
he had imparted the Secret and Power
to his Disciples of the <i>Priesthood</i> of
all Ages since, which would have been
of greatest Advantage to them in this
World. He has empower'd them, they
say, to remit Sins, which few old
Sinners think themselves the less in
danger for: And he has enabled them,
some say, to transubstantiate Bread into
Flesh, and Wine into Blood,
which none but foolish and superstitious
Folks believe they ever did:
And he promised to invest them with
a Power to do greater Miracles than
himself, even to remove Mountains,
and to curse Trees; but I thank God,
they never were of so strong a Faith,
as to put it in Practice, or we might
have heard of the <i>natural</i> state, as well
as we do now of the <i>civil</i> state of some
Countrys, ruin'd and overturn'd by
them. But this Power to transmute
<i>Water into Wine</i>, without Labour and
Expence, would have been of better
worth to them, than all their other
Priestly Offices. Not, that our Conduits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43_Book4" id="Page_43_Book4">[Pg 43]</a></span>
would thereupon run with Wine,
instead of Water; or that Wine would
be cheaper and more plentiful than it
is now, excepting among themselves, if
they could withal curse Vineyards.
They would make the best Penny they
a could of their divine Power. And as
surely as they can now fell the Waterdrops
of their Fingers at a Christening,
at a good Rate, they would set a better
Price on their miraculously made Wine,
and give a notable Reason for its dearness,
<i>viz.</i> that Miracles should not be
<i>cheap</i>, which would bring them into
Contempt, and lessen the Wonder and
Admiration of them."</p></blockquote>

<p>So ends the Invective of a suppos'd
Jewish <i>Rabbi</i> against this Miracle; which
our <i>Divines</i>, as well as myself, are to
consider of an Answer to. Whether they
shall think themselves able to answer the
rational Parts of it, consistently with the
Letter, I know not; but I own myself
unable, and believe it impossible for them,
to do it: And therefore they must of necessity
go along with me to the mystical
Interpretation of the Fathers; or this Miracle
will turn to the dishonour of <i>Jesus</i>,
and disadvantage of his Religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44_Book4" id="Page_44_Book4">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Justin Martyr</i><a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> says, it is absurd
to take the Stories of the Marriages and
Concubinages of the <i>Patriarchs</i> of the
Old Testament in a literal Sense. And
indeed, literally consider'd, they are some
of them too luscious Tales to be related
by divine and inspired Penmen: whereupon
he, as well as St. <i>Paul</i> and <i>Philo-Jud&aelig;us</i><a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>,
turn these Stories for the
Honour of God and Edification of his
Church, into an Allegory. Consequently,
if <i>Justin</i> had had an occasion to speak of
this Marriage before us, there's no doubt
on't, but he would have made Mystery of
all and every Part of it.</p>

<p>To the same purpose <i>Origen</i><a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> says,
"That since the Law is a shadow of
good Things to come, and writes sometimes
of Marriages and of Husbands
and Wives; we are not to understand
it of Marriages according to the Flesh,
but of the spiritual Marriage between
Christ and his Church. As for Instance,
<i>Abraham</i> had two Sons, <i>&amp;c.</i> here we
ought not to confine our Thoughts to
carnal Marriages, and their Offsprings;
but to extend them to the Mysteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45_Book4" id="Page_45_Book4">[Pg 45]</a></span>
here signified. And there are almost a
thousand other places in Scripture
about Marriages; but in every place
(<i>unusquisque Locus castum &amp; divinum
de Nuptiis continet Intellectum secundum
Expositionem moralem</i>) is to have
a divine, moral, and mystical Construction
put on't. Whoever therefore
reads the Scriptures about Marriages,
and understands no more by them, than
carnal Marriages; he errs, not knowing
the Scriptures, nor the Power of God."
From hence may be easily concluded,
what was <i>Origen</i>'s opinion about this Marriage
in <i>Cana</i> of <i>Galilee</i>, if there were
no other Passages in him for a Confirmation
of it. But to come closer to the Purpose.</p>

<p>St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> says, there is Mystery
signified in the Story of this Marriage,
as in all <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, which it becomes
us to open and search for; till, if
possible, we are <i>inebriated</i> with the spiritual
and invisible Wine, that <i>Jesus</i> made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46_Book4" id="Page_46_Book4">[Pg 46]</a></span>
at this Feast. And again<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> says, Let
us then consider the several Particulars of
the Story, and what is meant by the six
Waterpots; and the Water that is turn'd
into Wine; and the Governor of the
Feast; and who are the Bridegroom and
the Bride; and who is the Mother of <i>Jesus</i>
in a Mystery; and what is to be understood
by the Marriage.</p>

<p>And again, says St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>, there
is Mystery in this Marriage, or <i>Jesus</i> upon
no invitation had gone to it. The
Bridegroom is our Lord himself, to whom
it is said thou hast reserv'd the good Wine
of the Gospel <i>until now</i>, that is, until the
typified Time of the Celebration of this
mystical Marriage, which according to St.
<i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> is to be on the sixth Age
of the World, signified by the six Water-Pots,
holding two or three Firkins apiece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47_Book4" id="Page_47_Book4">[Pg 47]</a></span>
that is, all Mankind, as they are divided
into the <i>two</i> sorts of <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>,
or into <i>three</i>, as they are descended of the
<i>three</i> Sons of <i>Noah</i>.</p>

<p>And in another Place, the same St.
<i>Augustin</i> interpreting this Story, says<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
thus; "Our Saviour is invited to a Marriage;
what can that mean but that the
Holy Spirit is courted and invocated by
the Church, wishing to be espoused to
him? <i>Jesus</i> comes with his Disciples,
that is, into a holy Place of a Company
of Saints. <i>Mary</i> the Mother of our Lord
signifies to him, <i>that they have no Wine</i>;
so the Church makes known to him,
the Deficiency of the Spirit, which she
waits for the Power of. And if <i>Jesus</i>
calls <i>Mary</i>, a Woman; he means the
Church, who by Transfiguration may
be a Virgin, the Mother, the Spouse of
Christ, and a Whore too."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48_Book4" id="Page_48_Book4">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>And again St. <i>Augustin</i> explaining<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
what is meant by the Water, and the
Wine that it wou'd be turn'd into, at
the Time of the spiritual Celebration of
this Marriage of Christ with his Spouse of
the Church, says plainly enough, that by
<i>Water</i> is meant the Letter of the Scriptures;
and by the best <i>Wine</i> is to be understood
spiritual Interpretations, which
would transport the understandings of Men
with divine knowledge; and warm their
Hearts and Affections into a spiritual <i>Inebriation</i>;
after the similitude of Wine
natural.</p>

<p>St. <i>Theophilus</i> of <i>Antioch</i>, a most antient
Greek Commentator (who according to
<i>Bishop Smalbroke</i> should strictly adhere to
the Letter) says<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>, that by this Marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49_Book4" id="Page_49_Book4">[Pg 49]</a></span>
is meant the Conjunction of Christ
and his Church, as it is the Tradition of
the Old and New Testament. And that
<i>Jesus</i> himself is the Bridegroom; and
<i>Moses</i> the Governor of the Feast.</p>

<p>Other Fathers, such as St. <i>Cyril</i>, St.
<i>Theophylact</i> and St. <i>Jerome</i> are of the same
mind about the mystical Interpretation of
this Marriage, as might be prov'd by Passages
out of them, if I had room here to
cite them. But I must observe here, that
according to the Fathers, the Story of this
Marriage is but another Emblem of the
Marriage of the Lamb with the Bride of
the <i>New Jerusalem</i>, spoken of in the <i>Revelations</i>,
to which all the Fowls of the
Air will be invited, that is, spiritual and
heavenly minded Christians, who<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> soar
and fly aloft in their divine and sublime
Contemplations on the anagogical Sense
of the Scriptures, which will exhibit those
intellectual Dainties, they are there to be
entertain'd with.</p>

<p>What I have here said out of the Fathers
to the Story of this Marriage, is
enough to quicken our <i>Divines</i> to search
for the like mystical Interpretation of
the whole. The Part of it that's most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50_Book4" id="Page_50_Book4">[Pg 50]</a></span>
difficult to be spiritually expounded, is
that saying of <i>Jesus</i> to his Mother,
<i>Woman, what have I to do with thee?
mine Hour is not yet come.</i> For the clear
interpretation of which, I own, I meet
with little in the Fathers. But St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
assures us, there's latent Mystery
in the words. How then shall we
come at it? Why, if we cast away the
<i>Interrogation</i>, and look upon the Sentence,
as ellyptical, like an infinite number
of prophetical ones, the Sense paraphrastically,
and agreeably to the rest of
the Mystery, arises thus: In answer to
the Woman of the Church's Expectation
of the Wine of the Spirit; <i>Jesus</i> will
tell her or make her to understand of
what importance it is to her (and himself)
to be supply'd with that mystical
Wine to her Edification, which it was
not his time to pour forth upon the
Church, till the Celebration of his Nuptials
with her.</p>

<p>And thus have I done with the Miracle
of <i>Jesus</i>'s turning Water into Wine
at a Marriage of <i>Cana</i> of <i>Galilee</i>. Whether
it be not an absurd and offensive
Story according to the Letter, let any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51_Book4" id="Page_51_Book4">[Pg 51]</a></span>
one judge. If the supposed Jewish <i>Rabbi</i>
has forced a worse Sense upon it, than
it will naturally bear, our <i>Clergy</i> may
expostulate with him for it, which they
hardly will any otherwise than by Exclamations
against him, without Reason
and Authority. But in the mystical Operation
of this Miracle at the Marriage of
Christ with his Church, there will be
the Wisdom and Power and Goodness of
God visible. And it will be a demonstration
of <i>Jesus</i>'s <i>Messiahship</i>, in as much
as the Water of the Letter of the Law
and the Prophets can't be turn'd into the
Wine of spiritual Interpretations, but we
must discern how he is the Accomplisher
and Fulfiller of them. And so I pass to
an</p>

<p>11. <i>Eleventh</i> Miracle of Jesus, <i>viz.</i><a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
That of his healing a Paralytick,
for whom the Roof of the House was
broken up to let him down into the Room
where <i>Jesus</i> was.</p>

<p>And this Story (without excepting that
of the Pool of <i>Bethesda</i>) is the most
monstrously absurd, improbable and incredible
of any according to the Letter.
There is not one Miracle of <i>Jesus</i> specifically
related, that does not labour under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52_Book4" id="Page_52_Book4">[Pg 52]</a></span>
more or less Absurdities, either in
Substance or Circumstance: But this, for
number and greatness of Absurdities, I
think surpasses them all: And the Absurdities
of it too are so obvious and stare
a Man in the Face, that I wonder they
are hitherto overlook'd; and that considerate
and intelligent Persons have not
before now hesitated and boggled at them.
If Interest had not blinded the Eyes of
our learned <i>Clergy</i>, they would easily
have descry'd the Incredibilities and Absurdities
of this Story; and in another
<i>Impostor</i>'s Case presently have pointed
them out to the ridicule of his Admirers
and Adorers.</p>

<p>If a Man was to torture his Brains for
the Invention of a romantick Tale of improbable
and surprizing Circumstances,
that he might, withal, hope to palm for
a Truth, if it was but for a Week or a
Day, upon the Faith and Understanding
of the Credulous; he could never have
presumed, I think, so far upon the weakness
of their Intellects, as to imagine any
thing so grossly and notoriously contradictory
to Sense and Reason, would have
gone down with them, as is <i>this</i> before
us, which has pass'd currently thro' many
Ages of the Church, has been read
with attention by the Learned, and revered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53_Book4" id="Page_53_Book4">[Pg 53]</a></span>
by the rest of Christians, without
any exception, hesitation, or doubt of
the Truth of it. In short, so palpable is
the falsity of the Story of this Miracle,
that it requires no Sagacity to detect it;
and was it not for the sake of the Mystery
more than to expose the Folly of
the <i>Clergy</i> in believing of it, I had never
bestow'd the following Pains on it.</p>

<p>The People, it seems, so press'd and
throng'd about the Door of the House,
where <i>Jesus</i> was, that the Paralytick and
his Bearers could not get near it. What
did they so throng and press for? Was
it to see <i>Jesus</i>, who was <i>without Form
and Comeliness</i>, according to the Prophet
<i>Isaiah</i>; or, who was one of the most
graceful of the Sons of Men, as <i>Painters</i>
and <i>Publius Lentulus</i> do describe him?
This could not be the Reason of the
Croud. Tho' a Person extraordinary, either
for Beauty or Deformity may attract
the Eyes of the People, and occasion
too a Throng about him; yet this
could be no Reason for a <i>Press</i> about
<i>Jesus</i>, at <i>Capernaum</i>, where he dwelt,
and was commonly seen and well known.</p>

<p>Was it then to hear him preach?
Nor this neither. Tho' an excellent
Preacher does sometimes, and a very indifferent
one does oftener draw multitudes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54_Book4" id="Page_54_Book4">[Pg 54]</a></span>
after him; yet <i>Jesus</i>, as a Prophet,
was without Honour at <i>Capernaum</i>,
his own Country; consequently, it is
not to be supposed that, for his Doctrine,
he was so much follow'd here, tho'
we read, that he <i>preach'd the Word unto
them</i>.</p>

<p>Was it then to behold him working
of Miracles and curing of the diseased?
This is the likeliest Reason of the Crouds
and Throng about him. And perhaps
it was a Day appointed beforehand for
his healing of the diseased, which might
occasion a more than ordinary Concourse
of the People. But then this Reason
would have induced the People to make
way for the <i>Lame</i>, <i>Blind</i>, and <i>Paralyticks</i>
to come to <i>Jesus</i>; for they frustrated
their own Hopes and Expectations of
seeing Miracles wrought; and acted more
unreasonably than ever Mob did, or can
be supposed to do.</p>

<p>But whatever was the Reason of this
tumultuous Crouding, which is hard to
be accounted for; it's said, the poor
<i>Paralytick</i> with his Bearers could not
get to the Door of the House for the
<i>Press</i>, and therefore in all haste is he
haul'd to the Top of the House, and let
down, thro' a breach of the Roof, into
the Room where <i>Jesus</i> was. What need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55_Book4" id="Page_55_Book4">[Pg 55]</a></span>
was there of such Haste and Pains to get
to <i>Jesus</i> for a Cure? It was but waiting
a while, not many Hours, and in
all probability the Tumult would be appeas'd,
and access easily had to him.
But that the Bearers of the poor Man
should enterprise a trouble and difficulty,
that could not require less Time, than
the Tumult could be supposed to last,
is a little strange and somewhat incredible.</p>

<p>St. <i>Chrysostom</i> says<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>, that the <i>Paralytick</i>
saw that the Market-place or
Street was throng'd with People, who
had obstructed all Passage to the House,
where <i>Jesus</i> was; and yet he did not
so much as say to his Friends and Bearers,
"What's the Reason of this Tumult?
Let's stay till it is appeas'd,
and the House clear'd of the People,
who ere long will depart; and then
we shall privately and quietly get admittance
to Jesus," But why did he
not say so? Any one beside himself and
his Bearers, if they had any Reason and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56_Book4" id="Page_56_Book4">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Senses about them, would have so argued.
St. <i>Chrysostom</i> says, it was their
<i>Faith</i> that made them in such haste to
get to <i>Jesus</i>: But I should have thought
their <i>Faith</i> might have work'd <i>Patience</i>,
and disposed them to stay till Jesus could
come out to them, or they get in to him:
And it is an Addition to the strangeness
and incredibility of this Story, that it
did not.</p>

<p>But supposing this <i>Paralytick</i> in such
haste and danger of Life, that he could
not wait the dispersion of the Tumult,
but, for want of a free entrance at the
Door, is, cost what it will, to be rais'd
to the top of the House, and a breach
must be there made for him. The Question
is, whether such an Enterprize was
or could be feisable and practicable? I
have no Conception of the possibility of
it. If they could not get to the Door
of the House for the Press; of consequence
they could not come at the Sides
of it. How should they? over the Heads
of the People? That's not to be imagined;
consequently here's another difficulty
in the Story, that renders it yet
more strange and incredible.</p>

<p>But, without questioning the possibility
and easiness of getting the <i>Paralytick</i>
and his Couch over the Heads of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57_Book4" id="Page_57_Book4">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the Mob, to the sides of the House; thither
he is brought, where we now behold
him and his Bearers with their Pullies,
Ropes, and Ladders (that were not at
hand, nor could suddenly be procured)
hauling and heaving him to the top of
the House. Of what height the House
was, is not of much Consequence. Some
for the Credit of the Story may say<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>,
it was a <i>very low one</i>; tho' antient
and modern <i>Commentators</i> are pretty well
agreed, that it was an <i>upper-Room</i>, where
<i>Jesus</i> was; consequently the House was
at least two Stories high: But if it was
much higher, I'll allow that Art and
Pullies (which they wanted for the present)
would raise the Man and his Bed
to the top of it: So we will not dispute
nor differ upon that matter. On
the top of the House then, we are now
to behold the <i>Paralytick</i> and his Bearers
with their Hatchets and Hammers, <i>&amp;c.</i>
(which they forgot to bring with them,
for they could not think of any use
they should have of them) uncovering
the Roof of the House; breaking up
<i>Tiles</i>, <i>Spars</i>, and <i>Rafters</i>, and making a
Hole, capacious enough for the Man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58_Book4" id="Page_58_Book4">[Pg 58]</a></span>
his Bed to be let thro'. An odd, strange,
and unaccountable Work <i>this</i>, which, if
they had not been cunning Fellows, would
hardly have enter'd into their Heads to
project. But at work they are, when it
was well, if Jesus and his Disciples escaped
with only a broken Pate, by the falling
of Tiles, <i>&amp;c.</i>, and if the rest were
not almost smother'd with the Dust; for
it was over their Heads that the breach
was made. Where was the good Man of
the House all this while? Would he
suffer his House to be thus broken up,
and not command them to desist from
their foolish and needless Attempt, till
the Mob was quell'd, and there was a free
entrance at the Door of his House, which
could not be long first? Is there nothing
in all this, of difficulty and obstruction
in the way of the belief of this Story?</p>

<p>Some modern <i>Commentators</i>, being aware
of these difficulties in this Story,
and willing to reconcile Men to the earlier
belief of it, say, as <i>Drusius</i><a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> did,
that the Houses of <i>Jud&aelig;a</i> were <i>flat-roof'd,
and not ridg'd</i>: And Doctors,
<i>Lightfoot</i> and <i>Whitby</i><a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> say, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59_Book4" id="Page_59_Book4">[Pg 59]</a></span>
a Door on their flat Roofs, by which the
<i>Jews</i> used to ascend to the top of their
Houses, where they discours'd on the
Law and religious Matters; and that it
was thro' such a Door, by a little widening
of the sides of it, that the <i>Paralytick</i>
was let down in the presence of
<i>Jesus</i>. To which Opinion I would yield,
if it was not liable to these Objections,
<i>viz.</i> that it is not reconcilable to what
St. <i>Luke</i> says, of <i>their letting the Paralytick
down thro' the Tiling with his
Couch, in the midst, where Jesus was</i>;
nor hardly consistent with what St. <i>Mark</i>
says of their <i>uncovering</i> and <i>breaking
up the Roof of the House</i>: which Expressions
the <i>Evangelists</i> had never used,
if there had been a Door for him to descend
by. But to indulge <i>Lightfoot</i> and
<i>Whitby</i> in their Notion; I may ask them,
what occasion was there then of widening
the doorway, and breaking down
the sides of it? They'll say, because the
Passage otherwise was too narrow, for the
Man's Couch to get thro'. Why then
did not they take him out of his Couch,
and let him down in a Blanket, a Chair,
or a Basket? Or rather, why did not
<i>Jesus</i>, to prevent this Trouble and Damage
to the House, ascend thro' this Door, to
the Top of it, and their speak the healing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60_Book4" id="Page_60_Book4">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Word to this poor Man? To say, that
<i>Jesus</i> could not or would not go up to
the Paralytick, I would not, for Fear of
an Imputation of Blasphemy against me.
Our <i>Divines</i> therefore are to look for,
what they'll hardly find, an Answer to
the said Question, which will consist with
the Wisdom, the Goodness and Honour of
<i>Jesus</i>; or here will be another and insuperable
Bar to the Credibility of this
Story.</p>

<p>In short, there are more and greater Difficultys
affecting the Credit of this Miracle,
on the side of <i>Jesus</i>, than any before
urg'd. Could not he, as it was antiently<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
objected, have made the Access to
himself more easy? Could not he, to prevent
all this Trouble and Pains of getting
to the Top of the House, and of breaking
up the Roof of it, have desired or even
forc'd the People to make way for this
poor Man and his Bearers? This was not
impossible for him to do. If it was hard
for another; it was not for him, who was
omnipotent. He that could drive his
Thousands before him out of the Temple;
and draw as many after him into the wilderness,
might surely, by Force or Persuasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61_Book4" id="Page_61_Book4">[Pg 61]</a></span>
have made the People, how unreasonably
mobbish soever, to retreat. And
why did he not? Without a good and satisfactory
Answer, which I can't conceive,
to this Question, here is the most unaccountable
and incredible part of the whole
Story, that reflects on the Wisdom, the
Power and Goodness of <i>Jesus</i>. If there
had been no other absurd Circumstances of
it, this is enough to spoil its Credit, so
far as that I believe it impossible for
<i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Letter</i>, with all their
Wit, Penetration and Sagacity to get over
it.</p>

<p>Believe then the Story of this Miracle,
thus taken to Pieces, who can? It is such
an Accumulation of Absurdities, Improbabilities,
and Incredibilities, that a Man of
the most easy Faith, if he at all think,
can't digest. It's not credible, I said, to
suppose, the People of <i>Capernaum</i>, where
<i>Jesus</i> dwelt, and was well known and
little admired, would at all <i>press</i> to see
or hear him: And if the occasion of their
Concourse was to behold his Miracles;
it is less-reasonable to think they would
tumultuate to their own disappointment;
but rather make way for the diseased, for
the satisfaction of their own Curiosity, to
come to him: And if they did mob it
to their own disappointment, about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62_Book4" id="Page_62_Book4">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Door of the House; it was next to impossible
for the poor Man and his Couch
to be heav'd over their Heads, and rais'd
to the top of it: More unreasonable yet
to think, the master of the House would
suffer the Roof of it to be so broken up:
But most of all against Reason to suppose,
<i>Jesus</i> would not give forth the healing
word, and prevent all this Labour,
or by his divine Power disperse the People,
that the <i>Paralytick</i> might have present
and easy access to him.</p>

<p>Whether all this be not absolutely
shocking of the Credit of this Story, let
my Readers judge. In my Opinion, no
Tale more monstrously romantick can be
told. I don't here question <i>Jesus</i>'s Power
to heal this Paralytick, nor the miraculousness
of the Cure of him: The trouble
of that Question is saved me, by
the many other incredible Circumstances
of the Story, which are such a Contradiction
to Sense and Reason, as is not to
be equall'd, in any thing, that's commonly
receiv'd and believ'd by Mankind.
<i>Cicero</i> says, that there is nothing so absurd,
which some of the Philosophers have
not held. And they might and did, some
of them, hold gross Absurdities. But the
Letter of the Story of this Miracle before
us, which is the Object of the Faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63_Book4" id="Page_63_Book4">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of our learned Priesthood at this Day is
a Match for the worst of them.</p>

<p>But as absurd, as this Story is, I expect
that our <i>Clergy</i> will be disgusted at
my ludicrous display of it; and that
Arch Deacon <i>Stubbs</i> in particular will again
be ready to exclaim against me, and
say, that this is turning a <i>miraculous
Fact</i> and a <i>divine Testimony</i> of our Religion
into Ridicule. Whereupon it is
to be wish'd, <i>that Arch-Deacon</i> would
write, what would be a Pleasure to see,
a Vindication of this Story. If he can
account for the possibility and credibility
of the Letter of it, he shall have
my leave to make another dull Speech
in <i>Convocation</i> against me. And it is not
unlikely, but he may say as much for
it, as another Man: For as the Story is
senseless, so it is the better suited to his
Head and Brains. But if he don't, I
much question, whether any other Clergyman
of more Wit will, appear in Defence
of it.</p>

<p>So absurd is the Letter of this Story,
that for the Honour of <i>Jesus</i>, and Credibility
of his Gospel, it is absolutely
necessary to turn it into Allegory. To the
Fathers then, let us go for their help in
this Case. If they did not read me a better
Lecture upon this Miracle, than do our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64_Book4" id="Page_64_Book4">[Pg 64]</a></span>
modern <i>Commentators</i>, I should be almost
tempted to renounce my Religion upon
it: But as they have rationally and
rightly instructed me in its true meaning,
so I retain my Christian Faith, and admire
the Sublimity of the Mystery, which
I am now to give an account of.</p>

<p>By this <i>Paralitick</i>, St. <i>Hilary</i><a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
says, is to be understood <i>Mankind</i> of all
Nations, which opinion too the Fathers
held of the <i>Paralitick</i>, who was heal'd
at the Pool of <i>Bethesda</i>. And by his
Palsy is not meant any bodily Distemper,
but the spiritual Palsy of the Soul, that
is, as St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> and St. <i>Jerome</i><a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
interpret, a dissoluteness of Morals,
and an unsteadiness of Faith and Principles,
which is the Condition of Mankind
at present, who want <i>Jesus</i>'s help for
the Cure of it. <i>Eusebius Gallicanus</i><a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
says, our Saviour's words signify,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65_Book4" id="Page_65_Book4">[Pg 65]</a></span>
that it is not a bodily but a spiritual
Disease here meant; or he had never
said to the Paralytick, <i>Son, thy Sins are
forgiven thee</i>, which words respect the
inward Man, and demonstrate the Palsy
here to be a disease Of the Soul.</p>

<p>The Man sick of the Palsy had <i>four
Bearers</i>. And who are they mystically
in this Case? Why, the Fathers<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
understand by them the <i>four Evangelists</i>,
on whose Faith and Doctrine Mankind
is to be carry'd unto Christ; for no
Soul can be brought unto him, for the
Sanation of his Sins and Errors, but by
these <i>four</i>.</p>

<p>But to the top of the House is Mankind,
thus paralytically diseased, to be carry'd
by the four Evangelists, his Bearers. And
what then is this House and its Top?
The House of <i>Jesus</i> is the intellectual
Edifice of the World, otherwise call'd
Wisdom's House; of the beautiful Buildings
of which the Scriptures prophetically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66_Book4" id="Page_66_Book4">[Pg 66]</a></span>
treat: therefore to the <i>sublime Sense</i> of
the Scriptures, call'd the Top<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> of the
House, is Man to be taken: He is not
to abide in the <i>low and literal Sense</i><a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
of them, where People <i>press</i> and
strive in vain to come to <i>Jesus</i>: But if
he is taken to the Sublimity of the Scriptures
and there <i>open</i><a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> <i>the House</i> of
Wisdom, he will presently be admitted to
the Presence and Knowledge of <i>Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>Venerable <i>Bede</i>, who is altogether a
Transcriber of the Fathers, for which
Reason I cite him among the Fathers,
says<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>, that by the <i>Tiles</i> of the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67_Book4" id="Page_67_Book4">[Pg 67]</a></span>
spoken of in St. <i>Luke</i>, is meant the <i>Letter</i>
of the Scriptures, which is to be
laid open for the manifestation of Christ
and of divine Mysteries to the healing
of Man's spiritual Palsy, the unsteadiness
and dissoluteness of his Morals and
Principles.</p>

<p>So much, in short, then to the mystical
Interpretation of the Story of this Miracle.
The literal Sense of it is so encumber'd
with romantick Circumstances,
as are enough to turn a Man's Heart
against Christianity it self: But in the
Mystery there will be a most stupendous
Miracle, which will be not only an Argument
of <i>Jesus</i>'s divine Power, but of
his <i>Messiahship</i>, as certainly as his House
of Wisdom, of which the Scriptures
write, is open'd to the Manifestation of
his Presence, and to the Cure of Mankind
of his paralytical Disease, call'd an
instability of Faith and Principles.</p>

<p>And thus have I, in this <i>Discourse</i>,
taken into Examination three more of
<i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles; which I submit to the
Judgment of my Readers, whether the
literal Story of them does not consist of
Absurdities, Improbabilities and Incredibilities
according to the Proposition before
us; and whether there is not a
necessity, for the Honour of <i>Jesus</i>, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68_Book4" id="Page_68_Book4">[Pg 68]</a></span>
turn them into prophetical and parabolical
Narratives of what will be mysteriously
and more wonderfully done by
him.</p>

<p>My next <i>Discourse</i>, if my mind hold,
shall treat on the three Stories of <i>Jesus</i>'s
raising of the dead, <i>viz.</i> of the Widow
of <i>Naim</i>'s Son, of <i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter, and
of <i>Lazarus</i>; after which I will give the
literal History of Christ's Resurrection,
that sandy Foundation of the Church, a
Review; and so conclude my Discourses
on the Miracles of our Saviour.</p>

<p>To run thro' all the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>,
and handle them in the manner I have
done the foregoing, would be a long and
tedious Work. But if our <i>Divines</i> shall
think, I have selected only those Miracles,
which are obnoxious to Cavil and
Ridicule; and have omitted others, that
literally are a more unexceptionable
Testimony of <i>Jesus</i>'s divine Power, and
Authority; I will, for their Satisfaction
take more of them to Task, and give
the Letter of their Stories, the like ludicrous
treatment. If I mistake not, the
Miracles already spoken to, together with
those of <i>Jesus</i>'s raising of the dead, and
of his own Resurrection, are the most
famous and remarkable of any others:
And according to the Observation I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69_Book4" id="Page_69_Book4">[Pg 69]</a></span>
made on the rest, they are no less but rather
more liable to Ridicule and Exception.
But if any are of a contrary Opinion,
and will let me know, which in
their Judgment are more unexceptionable
Miracles, I will vouchsafe them
an Examination. I am sure there is not
one Miracle, which the Fathers of the
Church did not turn into Allegory; and
if we don't at this Day make mystical
Operations of them, they will none of
them according to the Letter, stand their
Ground, nor abide the Test of a critical
Inquiry into them.</p>

<p>I don't expect, that this <i>Discourse</i> will
be any more pleasing and acceptable to
the <i>Clergy</i>, who are <i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Letter</i>
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, as well as of the
Prophecies of him, than any of my former:
But their Displeasure in the Case
will give me no Disturbance, nor am I
concern'd about any Resentment, they
can make of it. If they are offended at
these <i>Discourses</i>, they should as they came
forth, have written solid Confutations
of them, and so have prevented my Publication
of any more of this kind: But
instead of serious and potent Reasonings
against me, I have met with little else
but oral Railings, Exclamations, Defamations,
and attempts for Prosecution;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70_Book4" id="Page_70_Book4">[Pg 70]</a></span>
which have been so far from terrifying
me, that they give me a secret Pleasure,
and animate me to proceed in the
Undertaking in hand.</p>

<p>I did not much question but the <i>Bishop</i>
of St. <i>Davids</i>, whom I look'd upon
as a Person of Ingenuity and Learning,
would, before this Time, have publish'd
somewhat in Confutation of one or other
of my former <i>Discourses</i>. Whether he
was not obliged to it, or to make me
some publick Reparation of the Injury
done to my Reputation, by his slanderous
Sermon, I appeal now to the worshipful
<i>Societys</i> for Reformation of Manners;
to whom, and to other Civil Magistrates,
I hope his Sermon, without
Reason, will be a Caution, that no Pulpit-Invective
move them to prosecute or
think the worse of any Author.</p>

<p>Liberty of thinking, writing and judging
for our selves in Religion is a natural,
a Christian, and a protestant <i>Right</i>: It is
a <i>Right</i> that the Magistrates as well as the
Subjects are interested in, and are to see
to the Conservation of, or their Understandings
as well as their Purses will be
ridden and oppress'd by an ignorant and
tyrannical Priesthood. I urge not this
for my own security against Prosecution
for Infidelity and Blasphemy, declaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71_Book4" id="Page_71_Book4">[Pg 71]</a></span>
that if the <i>Bishops</i> of <i>London</i>, St. <i>Davids</i>,
or <i>Arch-Deacon Stubbs</i>, who are
zealous for Persecution, will but engage
me on the Stage of Controversy, and
make good their Accusations against me,
I will submit to the worst Punishment,
that can be inflicted on the worst Offender.</p>

<p>In the mean time I will go on with
my Undertaking, to the advancement of
Truth, and demonstration of the <i>Messiahship</i>
of the Holy <i>Jesus</i>, to whom be
Glory for ever, <i>Amen</i>.</p>

pretend to, by the Dedication

know, that the less I have receiv'd,
the more there is behind: And I
can moreover assure them, that
their <i>Lordships</i> have it in their Heads
and their Hearts too, highly to advance
me in the World; and if their
Endeavours for my Promotion fail
not, I shall be a very <i>Great</i> Man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v_Book5" id="Page_v_Book5">[Pg v]</a></span></p>

<p>Such primitive Doctrine, <i>My
Lord</i>, as I have reviv'd, must, in the
Judgment of our <i>Bishops</i>, be deserving
of their distinguish'd Favours:
And if they should Design for me
such a <i>mystical</i> Crown of Glory, as
the <i>Gentile Priests</i> help'd some of
the Fathers of the Church to; I
profess without Dissimulation, that,
for all my Love to <i>Mysteries</i>, it will
be more than I am ambitious of:
But if the Honour is forc'd on me,
it will be my Duty to their <i>Lordships</i>,
to sound an <i>allegorical</i> Trumpet
of their Fame, that their
Names, which, might otherwise be
soon forgotten, may be everlastingly
remember'd for their Love and
Good-will towards me.</p>

<p>But the chief Foundation, <i>My
Lord</i>, of my Merits lies, they say,
in my Treatment of the Miracles
of our Saviour, after the Manner
you handled a Scripture-Prophecy,
of a <i>Man's kicking a Serpent on the
Pate, for biting him by the Heels</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi_Book5" id="Page_vi_Book5">[Pg vi]</a></span>
And if your <i>Lordship</i> got a <i>Welsh-Bishoprick</i>
upon it, what may not I
expect for my more meritorious
Works of the same kind? The
Great <i>Mr. Scheme</i> has celebrated
your Praise for that Effort of your
Wit: And I must needs say, to your
<i>Lordship</i>'s Applause, that were not
your Thoughts unhappily shackled
with Interest and Subscriptions, (an
Unhappiness you sadly lament!)
you would endeavour to make as
pleasant Work with the <i>Letter</i> of
the <i>Old</i>, as I can do with that of
the <i>New</i> Testament.</p>

<p>I have not here Room, <i>My Lord</i>,
for a sufficient and deserv'd <i>Encomium</i>
on your <i>Use and Intent of Prophecy</i>;
therefore must be content to
say of it, in short, that it is a most
curious Piece of, what the Fathers
call, <i>Engastromuthism</i>; or such a
singular Specimen of a Webb, spun
out of a Man's own Bowels, as one
of fewer Brains in his Head can
hardly equal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii_Book5" id="Page_vii_Book5">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>It was wisely done of your <i>Lordship</i>
to caution your Readers against
taking your <i>Book</i> for an Answer to
Mr. <i>Grounds</i>; otherwise it had not
been impossible, but some others as
well as the <i>Worshipful Benchers</i> of
the <i>Temple</i> might have mistaken
the <i>Use</i> and <i>Intent</i> of it.</p>

<p>After I had gone thro' your <i>beautifully-printed</i>
Work, I wish'd, <i>My
Lord</i>, for another <i>Decoration</i> of it,
that some Annotations out of the
Fathers had been subjoin'd to it.
How would your Notions then and
Theirs about Prophecy have stood
as a <i>Foil</i> to each other! How
should I then have admired the
Difference between a <i>Rich</i> Bishop
and a <i>Poor</i> Father as to Wit and
Sense! How should I then have
contemplated the Usefulness of Ecclesiastical
Wealth in our <i>Clergy</i> for
the Understanding of the Inspirations
of the poor old Prophets!</p>

<p>When your <i>Lordship</i> is call'd upon
for another Edition of your <i>Book</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii_Book5" id="Page_viii_Book5">[Pg viii]</a></span>
vouchsafe me the Favour of making
some marginal Remarks on it,
which shall not be without their
good Use. As you know, savoury
Sawce makes some sort of Food go
down the better; so a little more
of that Salt, which Mr. <i>Scheme</i> has
too sparingly sprinkled on your
<i>Work</i>, will give your <i>Readers</i>, a
right Relish of it: But whether I
am indulg'd this Favour or not; I
than take another opportunity, according
to Promise elsewhere made,
of testifying to the World, how
much I am,</p>

<p>ccording to Promise in my
last <i>Discourse</i>, I am in <i>this</i>
to take into Examination
the three Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>'s
raising the dead, <i>viz.</i> Of
<i>Iairus</i>'s Daughter<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>; of
the Widow of <i>Naim</i>'s Son<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>; and of
<i>Lazarus</i><a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>: The literal Stories of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_Book5" id="Page_2_Book5">[Pg 2]</a></span>
I shall show to consist of Absurdities, Improbabilities
and Incredibilities, in Order
to the mystical Interpretation of them:
And because some of our <i>Bishops</i> and <i>Clergy</i>
were a little disgusted at the ludicrous
Treatment of the <i>Letter</i> of some foregoing
Miracles, I will handle these with the
more Caution; being as unwilling, as any
Man of my primitive Faith can be, to
offend weak Brethren.</p>

<p>Whether <i>Jesus</i> rais'd any more from the
dead, besides the foresaid three Persons is
uncertain from the Evangelical History.
St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> thinks, he rais'd many
others; and he founds his Opinion on the
modest <i>Hyperbole</i> of St. <i>John</i>, who supposes<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
<i>the World it self could not contain
the Books that might be Written of Jesus</i>.
And <i>Eusebius Gallicanus</i>, of whose
Mind entirely I am, says<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> the Reason
lies in the Mystery, why these <i>three</i>, and
no more than these <i>three</i> Miracles of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_Book5" id="Page_3_Book5">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Kind are recorded by the <i>Evangelists</i>. But
since our <i>Divines</i> are averse to Mysteries on
Miracles, I would gladly know their Opinion,
whether <i>Jesus</i> rais'd any others from
the dead, or not: I have made some search
into modern Writers for their Opinion in
this Case, but can't find it: And unless
I knew their Opinion, it would be lost
Labour to argue against either Side of the
Question, and much more against both
Sides of it: But I can assure our <i>Divines</i>,
that, which Side of the Question soever
they should hold, the Consequence upon
the Argument would be neither better nor
worse, than that they must of necessity
espouse the mystical and allegorical Interpretation
of these Miracles, or grant that
<i>Jesus</i> literally rais'd none from the dead
at all.</p>

<p>But waving that sort of Argument for
the present against the <i>Letter</i>; these three
Miracles are reputed the greatest that <i>Jesus</i>
wrought: And I believe, it will be
granted on all hands, that the restoring a
Person, indisputably dead, to Life again,
is a stupendous Miracle; and that two or
three such Miracles well circumstanced,
and credibly reported, are enough to conciliate
the Belief of Mankind, that the
Author of them was a divine Agent, and
invested with the Power of God, or he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_Book5" id="Page_4_Book5">[Pg 4]</a></span>
could not do them. But God knows, (and
for the sake of the Mystery, I am not
sorry to say it) this is far from being the
Case of these three Miracles before us, or
of any one them.</p>

<p>That these three Miracles are not equally
great, but differ in Degree, is visible
enough to any one, that but cursorily reads,
and compares theirs Stories one with another.
The Fathers of the Church<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
have taken Notice of such a Difference
amongst them. The greatest of the three,
and indeed, the<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> greatest Miracle, that
<i>Jesus</i> is suppos'd to have wrought, is that
of <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection; which, in
Truth, was a most prodigious Miracle, if
his Corps was putrified and stank; or if
there were no just Exceptions to be made
to the Credibility of the Story. Next to
that, in magnitude, is <i>Jesus</i>'s raising of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5_Book5" id="Page_5_Book5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the Widow's Son, as they were carrying
him to his Burial: And a great Miracle it
was to bring him to Life again; if none before
or since had been mistaken for dead,
and carried to their Graves alive; or if
no Impostor and his Confederates could
frame such a seemingly miraculous Scene,
as is that whole Story, to his own Glory.
The least of the three is that of his raising
<i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter, which in Appearance
is so far from a Miracle, that according to
the Story itself, she was but asleep, or by
the Shrieks of By-standers frighted out of
her Senses for the present.</p>

<p>But however it really might be with
these three supposed dead and revived Persons;
the Case of none of them was well
enough circumstanced to serve the Purpose
of our <i>Divines</i>. I am apt to believe with
the Fathers, that <i>Jesus</i> actually did raise
the dead; but then, as these Miracles are
only recorded for the sake of the <i>Mystery</i>,
I affirm that none of them, as to the
<i>Letter</i>, will abide the Test of a critical
Examination, nor stand its Ground against
such Exceptions as may be made to them.
If <i>Jesus</i> was to raise any dead Bodies to
Life, for a Testimony of his divine Power
and Authority, he would and should have
made Choice of other dead Persons, under
other Circumstances of Death; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6_Book5" id="Page_6_Book5">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the History of their Resurrection should
have been more credibly and carefully
transmitted to Posterity, so as there should
have been no Room left to make a reasonable
Doubt of the Truth of it. But this,
I say, is not the Case in the Resuscitation
of any of these Persons, as will appear
from the following Remarks and Observations
upon them. And</p>

<p>1. Observe, that the unnatural and preposterous
Order of Time, in which these
Miracles are related, justly brings them all
under suspicion of Fable and Forgery.
The greatest of the three is indisputably
that of <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection; but since
this is only mention'd by St. <i>John</i>, who
wrote his Gospel after the other <i>Evangelists</i>,
and above sixty Years, according to
the best Computation, after our Lord's
Ascension; here is too much Room for
Cavil and Question, whether this Story be
not entirely his Invention. What could
be the Reason that <i>Matthew</i>, <i>Mark</i>, and
<i>Luke</i>, who all wrote their Gospel's before
<i>John</i>, and many Years nearer to the
Death of our Saviour, should omit to record
this remarkable and most illustrious
Miracle of <i>Lazarus</i>? They could not forget
it, nor be ignorant of it, if the Story
had been really true; and to assign any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7_Book5" id="Page_7_Book5">[Pg 7]</a></span>
other Reason than Ignorance or Forgetfulness,
is hard and impossible. To aggrandize
the Fame of their Master, for a Worker
of Miracles, was the Design of all the <i>Evangelists</i>,
especially of the three first, who
may be presumed to make a Report of
the greatest, if not of all, that <i>Jesus</i>
wrought: But that there should come
after them an <i>Evangelist</i> with an huge and
superlatively great Miracle, and meet with
Credit for it, is against all Sense and Reason;
neither is there any Story, so disorderly
told, in all History, that <i>Critics</i> will
admit of the Belief of. The first Writer
of the Life of an <i>Hero</i>, to be sure makes
mention of all the grand Occurrences of
it, and leaves no Room for <i>Biographers</i> afterwards,
but to enlarge and paraphrase
upon what he has written, with some
other Circumstances and Additions of less
Moment. If a third or a fourth <i>Biographer</i>
after him shall presume to add a more
illustrious Transaction of the <i>Hero</i>'s Life,
it will be rejected as Fable and Romance,
tho' for no other Reason than this, that the
first Writer must have been appris'd of it,
and would have inserted its Story, if there
had been any Truth in it. And whether
St. <i>John</i>'s Story of <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection,
that Miracle of Miracles, ought not to be
subjected to the like Criticism upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8_Book5" id="Page_8_Book5">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<i>Christians</i> may consider, and <i>Infidels</i> will
judge.</p>

<p>What then was the Reason, I ask again,
that the three first <i>Evangelists</i> neglected to
record this renown'd Miracle of <i>Lazarus</i>?
And why too (may I enquire here) did
not <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Mark</i> mention the Story
of the Widow of <i>Naim</i>'s Son, as they
could not but know of it, if true, more
certainly than <i>Luke</i>, the Companion of
<i>Paul</i>, who alone has made a Report of
it? <i>Grotius</i> says,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> <i>it may seem strange
that this illustrious Miracle of the Widow's
Son</i> was omitted by <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Mark</i>:
And what is the Reason that <i>Grotius</i> gives
for this strange Omission? Why, he tells
us<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> <i>that these two Evangelists were
content with one miraculous Instance of this
Kind, by which Christians might judge of</i>
Jesus'<i>s Power in others also</i>. And is this
Reason sufficient? True it is, they were
content with one Instance; but if they
had made a Report of two or three more
of the same sort, no body would have
thought their History of <i>Christ</i> overcharg'd
with impertinent and tautological Repetitions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9_Book5" id="Page_9_Book5">[Pg 9]</a></span>
But one Instance of a Person rais'd
from the dead, they were, says <i>Grotius</i>,
content with: And I'll grant one to be
sufficient: But which then should they, as
wise and considerate <i>Historians</i> have made
Choice of, the greatest or the least Miracle?
The greatest, to be sure, and that
was of <i>Lazarus</i>, or of the Widow's Son,
if they knew of either. But instead of either
of these, they tell us the Story of <i>Jairus</i>'s
Daughter, that is<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> an imperfect
and disputable Miracle, in Comparison of
the other two, which consequently they
knew nothing at all of, or they would have
preferr'd the Report of them.</p>

<p>If <i>Matthew</i>, the first Writer, had recorded
only the Story of <i>Lazarus</i>, whose
Resurrection was the greatest Miracle;
and if <i>Luke</i> had added <i>that</i> of the Widow
of <i>Naim</i>'s Son; and <i>John</i> lastly had
remember'd us of <i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter, which
the other <i>Evangelists</i>, not through Ignorance
or Forgetfulness, but studying Brevity,
had omitted, then all had been
well; and no Objection had hence lain
against the Credit of any of these Miracles,
or against the Authority of the <i>Evangelists:</i>
But this unnatural and preposterous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10_Book5" id="Page_10_Book5">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Order of Time, in which these
Miracles are recorded (the greatest being
postponed to the least) administers just
Occasion of suspicion of the Truth and
Credibility of all their Stories. And it is
lucky for Christianity, that <i>Jews</i> and <i>Infidels</i>
have not hitherto hit upon the <i>Absurdity</i>
of this preposterous Narration, or
they might have form'd a cogent Objection
against these Miracles thus, saying;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Jesus</i>, it is manifest, rais'd not the
dead at all. The only Person, that
Christians can reasonably pretend, he
did raise, was <i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter, whom
<i>Matthew</i> writes of; and she, according
to the Story was only in a Sleep, or an
Extacy, when <i>Jesus</i> revived her. But
the <i>Galileans</i>, who were after a Time
call'd <i>Christians</i>, finding their Account
in a Resurrection-Miracle; <i>Luke</i>, for
the former Advantage of the Cause, devised
another Story of better Circumstances,
in the Widow of <i>Naim</i>'s Son:
But this not being so great a Miracle, as
the Church still wanted; <i>John</i>, when
no body was alive to contradict and expostulate
with him for it, trumps up a
long Story of a thumping Miracle, in
<i>Jesus</i>'s raising of <i>Lazarus</i>, who had
been not only dead, but buried so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11_Book5" id="Page_11_Book5">[Pg 11]</a></span>
that he stank again. But to prove the
Story of this Miracle to be false and fabulous,
we need say no more than that
it was last recorded. If there had been
any Truth in it, the first <i>Evangelist</i>
would have remember'd us of it.</p>

<p>"We don't suppose, that you Christians,
because of your Prejudices, will subscribe
to this Account, that we thus
give of the Rise of these Miracles: But
this is certain, that if these three Miracles
had not been reported of <i>Jesus</i>,
but of <i>Mahomet</i>, in the same disorder of
Time, by three different Historians,
you would presently have scented the
Forgery and Imposture: You would
justly have affirm'd that the three Stories
were apparently three Fables and Falsehoods;
and that the three Historians
visibly strove to outstretch each other:
That the <i>first</i> was sparing and modest in
his Romance; and the <i>second</i>, being sensible
of the Insufficiency of the former's
Tale, devises a Miracle of a bigger
Size; which still not proving sufficient to
the End proposed; the <i>third</i> Writer,
rather than his Prophet's Honour should
sink for want of a Resurrection-Miracle,
forges a Story of a monstrously huge
one; against which it is, and always will
be Objection enough, that it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12_Book5" id="Page_12_Book5">[Pg 12]</a></span>
related by the first Historian. So would
you Christians argue against these three
Miracles in another Impostor's Case;
and there is not a judicious <i>Critic</i> in the
Universe, that would not approve of
the Argument, and applaud the Force
of it, tho' you will not endure the
Thoughts of it in the Case of your
<i>Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>"But to come nearer home to you;
supposing <i>John</i> (who was then above a
Hundred, and in his Dotage) had not
reported this Miracle of <i>Lazarus</i>; but
that <i>Clement</i> (joining it with his<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> incredible
Story of the Resurrection of a
<i>Ph&#339;nix</i>) or <i>Ignatius</i>, or <i>Polycarp</i>, or the
Author of the <i>Apostolical Constitutions</i>
had related it; would not your Christian
<i>Critics</i> have been at work to explode
it? There is not an antient extra-evangelical
Tradition of any Note about
<i>Jesus</i>, that some or other of your <i>Critics</i>
have not boggled at; but such a
Story as this of <i>Lazarus</i> would have
been received by none. I question,
whether Mr. <i>Whiston</i> would not have
rejected the <i>Constitutions</i> upon such a
Story in them; or if his Fancy for some
other Things in them had overcome his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13_Book5" id="Page_13_Book5">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Reason against this; yet <i>Bishop Smallbroke</i>,
who has written against the Canonicalness
of the <i>Constitutions</i>, with
his judicious Animadversions upon this
Story, would absolutely have overthrown
their Authority. And what
would he have said here? Not only
that the Miracle smells rankly of Forgery
and Fraud, or the <i>Evangelists</i>, especially
<i>Matthew</i>, had never forgotten to
record it; but he would have reminded
us of intrinsic Notes (<i>hereafter to be mention'd</i>)
of Absurdity, and Incredibility,
that would for ever have cashier'd the
Belief of it. And whether we <i>Infidels</i>
ought not to take the same Liberty to
criticize on <i>John</i>'s Gospel, which you
do on your Apostolical Fathers, who
wrote before him, let the impartial and
unprejudiced judge: If in justice we
ought to take it; we are sure we could
give two or three notable Reasons (but
that We will not now put Christians
out of Temper with them) why <i>John</i>
may be suspected of a Mistake or Fraud
in this Miracle, rather than any other
Christian Writer of the <i>first</i> or <i>second</i>
Century."</p></blockquote>

<p>To such an unhappy Objection, arising
from the unnatural and preposterous Order
of Time, in which they are recorded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14_Book5" id="Page_14_Book5">[Pg 14]</a></span>
are these three Miracles before us obnoxious.
And I am thinking how Ministers of
the Letter will be able to get over it. As
for my self, who am for the mystical Interpretation
of these Miracles, I have a solid
and substantial Answer at hand to the foresaid
Objection, an Answer that curiously
accounts for the Order of Time in which
these Miracles are related; but my Answer
will not please our <i>Divines</i>, nor stand them
in any stead; therefore they must look up
another good one of their own, that will
comport with the <i>Letter</i>; or the said Objection,
improved with another presently
against <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection, will be too
hard, not for Christianity it self, but for
their Ministry.</p>

<p><i>Grotius</i>, being aware of the foresaid
Objection, has given us such a<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Solution
of it as then occurr'd to his Thoughts.
Dr. <i>Whitby</i>, not being satisfied with <i>Grotius</i>'s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15_Book5" id="Page_15_Book5">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Solution, has given us<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> another:
But how weak and insufficient both their
Solutions are, I will not spare Time to
consider, till some <i>Writer</i> shall appear in
Defence of the Sufficiency and Strength of
one or other of them. And so I pass to a</p>

<p>2. Second Observation, by Way of Objection
to the <i>Letter</i> of these Miracles, and
that is, by enquiring, what became of
these three Persons after their Resurrection?
How long did they live afterwards? And
of what Use and Advantage were their
restored Lives to the Church or to Mankind?
The Evangelical and Ecclesiastical
History is entirely silent as to these Questions,
which is enough to make us suspect
their Stories to be merely romantick or
parabolical; and that there were no such
Persons rais'd from the dead; or we must
have heard somewhat of their Station and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16_Book5" id="Page_16_Book5">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Conversation in the World afterwards.
It's true, that <i>Ephiphanius</i><a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> says, what
he found among Traditions, that <i>Lazarus</i>
lived thirty Years after his Resurrection:
But how did he spend his Time all that
while? Was it to the Honour of <i>Jesus</i>,
to the Service of the Church, and Propagation
of the Gospel? Of that we know
nothing; tho' in Reason and Gratitude to
<i>Jesus</i>, his Benefactor, it ought to have
been so spent; and if it had been so employ'd,
History surely would have inform'd
us of it. According to the Opinion of
<i>Grotius</i>, in a Citation above, <i>Lazarus</i> for
the rest of his restored Life absconded, and
skull'd about the Country for Fear of the
<i>Jews</i>, who lay in Wait for him; which is
a Suggestion, not only dishonourable to
<i>Jesus</i>, as if the same Power, that rais'd
him from the dead, could not protect him
against his Enemies; but reproachful to
<i>Lazarus</i> himself, who should have chosen
to suffer Death again, rather than not bear
an open Testimony to <i>Jesus</i>, the Author
of his Resurrection. However it was, we
hear no more of <i>Lazarus</i>, than that he
lived thirty Years afterwards, which Tradition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17_Book5" id="Page_17_Book5">[Pg 17]</a></span>
without other Memorials of his
Life, brings the Miracle more under suspicion
of Fable, than if he had dy'd soon
after it. And of <i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter, and of
the Widow of <i>Naim</i>'s Son, which is astonishing,
we read nothing at all. Does not
this Silence in History about them, make
their Miracles questionable, and but like
<i>Gulliverian</i> Tales of Persons and Things,
that out of the Romance, never had any
Being.</p>

<p><i>Jesus</i> did but<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> <i>call a little Child, and
set him in the midst</i> of his Disciples; and
that Act was remember'd in the Piety and
Zeal<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> of <i>Ignatius</i>, who made a renown'd
Bishop. But the Favour and Blessing
conferr'd on these three rais'd Persons
was exceedingly greater; and one might
have expected, that <i>Lazarus</i> and the Widow's
Son would have been eminent Ministers
of the Gospel. But instead of that,
their Lives afterwards were pass'd in Obscurity,
or, what's as bad, Ecclesiastical
History has neglected a Report of them.
What can any one hereupon think less,
than that the Favour of the Miracles was
lost on undeserving Persons, which I abhor
the Thoughts of; or that their Stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18_Book5" id="Page_18_Book5">[Pg 18]</a></span>
are but Parables, which I rather incline to.</p>

<p>Ministers of the <i>Letter</i> may here say,
"That the Ecclesiastical History of the Apostolical
Age is very scanty; and that
many Memorials of other Persons and
Transactions are lost and buried in Oblivion:
Which unhappy Fate has attended
the after-Lives and Actions of
these rais'd Persons, or undoubtedly we
should have had a famous Record of
them." This is not impossible; tho'
in the Wisdom of Providence it is hardly
probable, but that some more Remembrance
must have been left of one or other,
if not of all the three Persons; in as
much as such a Remembrance of them
would now-a-days have no less gain'd a
Belief of the Miracles, than this Historical
Silence tends to the Discredit of them.</p>

<p>It's somewhat strange, that we hear no
more of the after-Fame and Life of any
of the diseased Persons, whom <i>Jesus</i> miraculously
cured; excepting of the Woman,
heal'd of an Issue of Blood; who,
tho' she <i>spent</i> ALL <i>she had, even</i> ALL
<i>her Living</i> upon <i>Physicians</i>; yet out of
the Remains of it erected, says<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> <i>Eusebius</i>,
at <i>C&aelig;sarea Philippi</i>, two most costly
Statues of Brass, to the Memory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19_Book5" id="Page_19_Book5">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<i>Jesus</i> and of herself, and of the Miracle
wrought by him; which Dr. <i>Whitby</i><a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
as if he was tainted with Infidelity, endeavours
to make an idle Tale of. But excepting,
I say this Story of this Woman,
we hear nothing of any other heal'd Person;
which is Matter of some Speculation:
But that the Persons rais'd from
the dead should not at all be mention'd
in History for their Labours and Lives
afterwards to the Honour of <i>Jesus</i>, is absolutely
unaccountable. Whether such a
profound Silence in History about them be
not shocking of the Credit of the Miracles,
let our <i>Divines</i> consider. I am of
Opinion that if <i>Jesus</i> really rais'd these Persons
from the dead; this and no other Reason,
in the Providence of God, can be given
for the Silence of Ecclesiastical History
about them afterwards, than to make
<i>dead-letter'd</i> Stories of their Miracles, in
order to turn our Heads entirely to the
Consideration of their mystical Signification,
without which the <i>Letter</i>, for the
Argument before us, is deserving of no
Regard nor Credit. But</p>

<p>3. By way of Objection to the <i>Letter</i>
of these three Miracles, let us consider the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20_Book5" id="Page_20_Book5">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Condition of the Persons rais'd from the
dead; and whether they were at all proper
Persons for <i>Jesus</i> to work such a Miracle
upon, in Testimony of his divine
Power. If they were improper Persons
according to the <i>Letter</i>, it's not credible
that He, who was the Wisdom of God,
would raise them; or if he did, it was
because they were the properest to make
mystical Emblems of their Stories.</p>

<p>That <i>Jesus</i> ought to have rais'd all that
dy'd, where-ever he came, during the
Time of his Ministry, none, I presume,
can hold. Two or three Instances of his
almighty and miraculous Power of this
Kind will be allow'd to be sufficient:
But then they must be wisely and judiciously
made Choice of, out of a vast Number
of Persons, that must needs die in
that Time. Where then was his Wisdom
and Prudence to chuse these three Persons
above others to that Honour? Why were
all of them, or indeed any one of them
preferr'd to other Persons of a different
Age and Condition in the World? Nay,
if the <i>Letter</i> of their Stories is only to be
regarded, were not all these three Persons
almost the improperest and most unfit
of any for <i>Jesus</i> to exercise that Power
on?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21_Book5" id="Page_21_Book5">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter was an insignificant
<i>Girl</i> of twelve Years old: And there
could be no Reason for raising her, but to
wipe sorrow from the Hearts, and Tears
from the Eyes of her Parents, who ought
to have been better Philosophers, than immoderately
to grieve for her. And was
here a good Reason for <i>Jesus</i> to interpose
with his Almighty Power? No certainly;
a Lecture of Patience and Resignation
this Case had been enough. And tho'
<i>Jesus</i> could raise her from the dead; yet
for as much as that Favour was to be conferr'd
but on a few; and his Miracles
ought to be useful as well as conspicuous,
she should have been pass'd by, as an improper
Object of his Power, in Comparison
of many others, presently to be named.
If therefore a better Reason, than
what's discernible in the <i>Letter</i>, is not to
be fetch'd from the Mystery; I can't suppose
that <i>Jesus</i>, the Wisdom of God would
raise this <i>Girl</i>; but that the modern Belief
of her Resuscitation, exclusive of the
mystical Signification, is, as shall be by and
by argued, altogether groundless.</p>

<p>The Widow of <i>Naim</i>'s Son too was
but a νεανισκος <i>Youth</i>, and whether any
thing older than the <i>Girl</i> above is doubtful;
but his Life certainly was of no
more Importance to the World after, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22_Book5" id="Page_22_Book5">[Pg 22]</a></span>
before his Resurrection. And why was
he then one of the <i>three</i> to be rais'd from
the dead? Why had he this Honour done
him, before others of greater Age, Worth,
and Use to Mankind? Some will say, for
the Comfort or his sorrowful Mother.
And is this Reason sufficient? A Discourse
on the Pleasures of <i>Abraham</i>'s Bosom,
where she would e'er long meet her Son,
had been enough to chear her Heart. If
therefore the Fathers don't help me to a
solid mystical Reason, why the Son and
<i>only Son</i> of a Widow was to be rais'd by
<i>Jesus</i>, as they were carrying him to his Burial,
I'll not believe, He would raise this
dead <i>Boy</i> rather than many others, for the
Manifestation of his Power; but that the
Story of his Resurrection, as shall soon be
reasonably proved, was all Sham and Cheat.</p>

<p><i>Lazarus</i> indeed was <i>Jesus</i>'s Friend,
whom he Loved; and as I will not question
but <i>Jesus</i>'s Affection was wisely and
deservedly placed on him; so here, to
Appearance, was a better Reason for the
raising of him, than of either of the other
Two. But even this Reason, supposing
<i>Jesus</i> was to raise but three Persons, is
not sufficient against the Cases of many
others, that may be put for the Manifestation
of his Power, for the Illustration
of his Wisdom and Goodness, and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23_Book5" id="Page_23_Book5">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Conversion of Unbelievers: Consequently,
if this Story of <i>Lazarus</i> be not parabolical,
the litteral Fact is disputable, and obnoxious
to such Exceptions presently to be observed
against it, as will not be easily got
over.</p>

<p><i>Jesus</i> rais'd the dead, and wrought other
Miracles, say our <i>Divines</i> often, not
only to manifest his own Power and Glory,
but his Love to Mankind, and his
Inclination to do them good: For which
Reason his Miracles are useful and beneficial
as well as stupendous and supernatural
Acts, on purpose to conciliate Men's
Affections as well as their Faith to him.
On this Topick our <i>Divines</i> are copious
and rhetorical, when they write on <i>Jesus</i>'s
Miracles, as if no more useful and wonderful
Works could be done, than what
he did. And I do agree with them, that
(what Reason bespeaks) the Miracles of a
pretended Author of Religion ought to be
both as useful and great as well as could
be. But such were not <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles
according to <i>Letter</i>, and least of all his Acts
of raising the dead. For if we consider
the Persons rais'd by him, we shall find,
he could hardly have exerted his Power
on any of less Importance to the World,
both before and after their Resurrection.
A young <i>Girl</i> indeed is fitter to be raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24_Book5" id="Page_24_Book5">[Pg 24]</a></span>
than a decripid old Woman, who by the
Course of Nature was to return to Corruption
again, as soon as restored to Life:
And a <i>Boy</i> rather than an infirm old Man
for the same Reason: And <i>Lazarus</i> the
Friend of <i>Jesus</i>, perhaps, and but perhaps,
rather than his profess'd Enemy. But
what are these three Persons in Comparison
of many others of other Circumstances?
Instead of a <i>Boy</i>, and a <i>Girl</i> and
even of <i>Lazarus</i>, who were all of no
Consequence to the Publick, either before
or since; I should think, <i>Jesus</i> ought to
have rais'd an useful Magistrate, whose
Life had been a common Blessing; an industrious
Merchant, whose Death was a
publick Loss; a Father of a numerous
Family, which for a comfortable Subsistance
depended on him. Such dead Objects
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Power and Compassion
could not but offer themselves, during the
Time of his Ministry, and if he meant to
be as useful as he could, in his Miracles,
he would have laid hold on them. If a
few Persons only were to be rais'd from
the dead, the foresaid were the properest,
whose Resurrection and Return to Life
would have begotten the Applause as well
as the Wonder of the World; would
most extensively have spread <i>Jesus</i>'s Fame;
and would have gain'd him the Love and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25_Book5" id="Page_25_Book5">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Discipleship of all that heard of his being
so great a Benefactor to Mankind. Such
Instances of his Power would have demonstrated
him to be a most benign as
well as a mighty Agent; and none in Interest
or Prejudice could have open'd their
Mouths against him, especially if the Persons
rais'd from the dead were selected
upon the Recommendation of the People
of this or that City. But that an insignificant
<i>Boy</i> and a <i>Girl</i>, (forsooth!) and the
obscure <i>Lazarus</i>, are preferr'd by <i>Jesus</i>,
to such publick and more deserving Persons
is unaccountable. Their Story therefore,
upon this Argument, savours of Romance
and Fraud; and unless the <i>Mystery</i>
help us to, what the <i>Letter</i> can't, a good
reason for <i>Jesus</i>'s Conduct here, the Miracles
may be hence justly question'd, and
the Credibility of their Report disputed.</p>

<p>But now I am speaking of the Fitness
and Unfitness of deceased Persons to have
this grand Miracle wrought on them; it
comes into my Head to ask, why <i>Jesus</i>
rais'd not <i>John</i> the Baptist to Life again?
A Person of greater Merits, and more
Worthy of the Favour of <i>Jesus</i> and of
this Miracle, could not be. If <i>Jesus</i>
could raise any from the dead he would
surely have raised him; and why did he
not? This is a reasonable Question and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26_Book5" id="Page_26_Book5">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Answer should be thought on for it. Was
it a Thing out of <i>Jesus</i>'s Power? Not so;
He was Omnipotent, and could by Force
or Persuasion have rescued <i>John</i>'s Head out
of the Hands of his Enemies; and the
tacking it again to his Body, and the infusing
new Life into him was no more difficult
to <i>Jesus</i>, than the Resuscitation of a
stinking Carcass. If <i>Jesus</i> had here exerted
his Power, and rais'd his dearest Friend
and choicest Minister for the Preparation,
if not Propagation of the Gospel, none
could question his Ability to raise any
others, tho' he had rais'd no more. But
in as much as <i>John</i> the <i>Baptist</i>, one of his
singular Merits and Services to <i>Christ</i>, was
overlook'd and neglected by him; and
three useless and insignificant Persons had
this Honour done them, the Facts may reasonably
be called into question, and, if
the Mysteries don't solve the Difficulty,
their litteral Stories may hence be accounted
foolish, fictitious and fabulous; especially
if we consider,</p>

<p>4. That none of these three rais'd Persons
had been long enough dead to amputate
all Doubt of <i>Jesus</i>'s miraculous
Power in their Resurrection. As to <i>Jairus</i>'s
Daughter, she was but newly expired, if
at all dead, when <i>Jesus</i> brought her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27_Book5" id="Page_27_Book5">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Life again. <i>Jesus</i> himself says, she was
but asleep. And according to <i>Theophanes
Cerameus</i><a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>, and <i>Theophilact</i><a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> there
is Room to suspect that this <i>Girl</i> was only
Κατοχος <i>beside herself</i>. And it is not impossible,
but the passionate Skreams of the
Feminine By-standers might fright her into
Fits, that bore the Appearance of Death;
otherwise why did <i>Jesus</i> turn there inordinate
Weepers out of the House, before
he could bring her to her Senses again? And
why did he tell her Parents, that she was
only in a sleep, but to Comfort them with
the Possibility of his awakening her out of it?
Is not this destructive of the Miracle, and
making no more of it, than what another
Man might do? And is there not some
Probability, that here's all of this Story?
But supposing she was really dead, yet for
the sake of an indisputable Miracle in her
Resurrection, it must be granted, that she
ought to have been much longer, some
Days if not Weeks, dead and buried.</p>

<p>As to the Widow of <i>Naim</i>'s Son, there
was somewhat more of the Appearance of
Death in him, than in <i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter.
He was carried forth to his Burial, and so
may be presumed to be really a dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28_Book5" id="Page_28_Book5">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Corpse. But might not here be Fraud or
Mistake in the Case? History and common
Fame affords Instances of the mistaken
Deaths of Persons, who sometimes
have been unfortunately buried alive, and
at other Times happily, by one Means or
other, restored to Life: And who knows
but <i>Jesus</i>, upon some Information or
other, might suspect this Youth to be
in a lethargick State, and had a Mind to
try, if by chafeing, <i>&amp;c.</i> he could not do,
what successfully he did, bring him to his
Senses again: Or might not a Piece of
Fraud be here concerted between <i>Jesus</i>,
a subtil Youth, and his Mother and others;
and all the Formalities of a Death and Burial
contrived, that <i>Jesus</i>, whose Fame for
a Worker of Miracles was to be rais'd,
might here have an Opportunity to make a
shew of a grand one. The Mourning of
the Widow, who had her Tears at Command
and <i>Jesus</i>'s casual meeting of the
Corpse upon the Road, looks like Contrivance
to put the better Face upon the
Matter. God forbid, that I should suspect,
there was any Fraud of this Kind
here; but of the Possibility of it, none
can doubt. And where there is a Possibility
of Fraud, it is Nonsense, and
mere Credulity to talk of a real, certain
and stupendous Miracle, especially where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29_Book5" id="Page_29_Book5">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the Juggler and pretended Worker of Miracles
has been detected in some of his
other Tricks. All that I have to say here
to this Matter, is, that if <i>Jesus</i> had a
Mind to raise the Son of this Widow, in
Testimony of his divine Power, he should
have suffer'd him to have been buried two
or three Weeks first; otherwise, if the
Mystery don't account for <i>Jesus</i>'s stopping
the Bearers of the Corpse upon the Road,
here is too much Room for suspicion of
Cheat in the Letter of the Story.</p>

<p><i>Lazarus</i>'s Case seems to be the less exceptionable
of the three. He had been buried
<i>four Days</i>, and supposed to be putrified in
the Opinion of his Sister <i>Mary</i>, and of modern
Christians: And if so, his Resuscitation
was a most grand and indisputable
Miracle. And I could have wish'd, if I
had not loved the <i>Mystery</i> rather than
the <i>Letter</i>, that no Cavil and Exception
could have been made to it. Whether <i>Lazarus</i>,
who was <i>Jesus</i>'s Friend and beloved
Disciple, would not come into Measures
with his Lord, for the Defence of his Honour,
and Propagation of his Fame, <i>Infidels</i>,
who take Christianity for an Imposture,
will not question: And whether he
would not consent to be interr'd alive, in
a hollow Cave, where there was only a
Stone laid at the Mouth of it, as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30_Book5" id="Page_30_Book5">[Pg 30]</a></span>
a Man could fast, none of them will doubt.
Four Days was almost too long for a Man
to fast without danger of Health; but if
those <i>four Days</i> are number'd according to
the Arithmetick of Jesus's <i>three Days</i> in his
Grave, they are reducible to two Days and
three Nights, which Time, if no Victuals
were secretly convey'd with him, a Man
might fast in <i>Lazarus</i>'s Cave. As to the
<i>stinking</i> of <i>Lazarus</i>'s Carcass: that, <i>Infidels</i>
will say, was but the Assertion of his Sister
beforehand, like a Prologue to a Farce.
None of the Spectators at his Resurrection
say one Word of his stinking. And as to
the Weepings and Lamentations of <i>Jesus</i>
and of <i>Lazarus</i>'s Sisters, they will say
that was all Sham and Counterfeit, the
better to carry on the Juggle of a feign'd
Resurrection. And what's worst of all,
they will say, that tho' <i>Jesus</i> did call <i>Lazarus</i>
forth with a <i>loud Voice</i>, as if he had
been as deaf as a dead Man; yet his <i>Face
was bound about with a Napkin</i>, so that
the Spectators could not discern what was
of the Essence of the Miracle, the Change
of his Countenance from a dead to a live
one, which is a plain Sign, that it was all
Fraud and Imposture.</p>

<p>God forbid, that I should have the same
sense with <i>Infidels</i>, of this Matter; but to
be just to their Suggestions and Imaginations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31_Book5" id="Page_31_Book5">[Pg 31]</a></span>
here, I must needs say, there are some
other unhappy Circumstances, presently to
be consider'd, in this Story, which, if they
are not emblematical, make it the most
notorious Cheat and Imposture that ever
was put upon Mankind. In the mean
Time, from what is here argued, it is
plain, that <i>Lazarus</i> was not so long dead
and buried, as that there is no Room to
doubt of the Miracle of his Resurrection.</p>

<p>Now whether these Arguments against
these three Miracles, drawn from the
Shortness of the Time, in which these
Persons lay for dead, have any Force in
them, let our <i>Divines</i> consider. If nothing
of all this is in their Opinion affecting
of the Credit of the Miracles; yet
they must allow, that <i>Jesus</i>, if he could
raise the dead, might have made Choice of
other Instances of Persons, more unquestionably
dead, who had lain longer in their
Graves, and were in a visible State of Putrefaction.
And if this grand Miracle of raising
the dead was to be wrought by <i>Jesus</i> for
the Manifestation of his Glory, and in
Testimony of his Authority; he should
have exercised his Power on some such
Persons, nominated by the Magistrates of
this or that City, who with the People
should be present at the miraculous Operation,
beholding the putrified Bodies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32_Book5" id="Page_32_Book5">[Pg 32]</a></span>
(without a Napkin before their Faces) and
how they were suddenly enliven'd and invigorated
with new Flesh, after the Similitude
of their pristine Form, when in
Health and full Strength. Because that <i>Jesus</i>
rais'd not some such Persons to Life,
I must take the Stories of the three Miracles
before us to be but typical of more
mysterious Works; or believe them for
the Arguments above to be downright
Cheats and Fables. And what is enough
to induce a modern <i>Divine</i> to this Opinion.
Is</p>

<p>5. The Consideration, that none of
these rais'd Persons did or could, after the
Return of their Souls to their Bodies, tell
any Tales of their separate Existence otherwise
the Evangelists had not been silent
in this main Point, which is of the
Essence of Christianity. Are not our <i>Divines</i>
here reduced to an unhappy <i>Dilemma</i>,
either to deny the separate Existence of the
Soul, or the precedent Deaths of these
rais'd Persons? As Christians, We profess
to believe both, which seemingly are incompatiable;
or the Evangelists had made
such a Relation, as their return'd Souls had
given of the other World. Was any Person,
in this Age, to be rais'd to Life, that
had been any time dead; the first Thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33_Book5" id="Page_33_Book5">[Pg 33]</a></span>
that his Friends and Acquaintance would
enquire of him, would be to know, where
his Soul had been; in what Company;
and how it had fared with him; and Historians
would certainly record his Narrative.
The same Curiosity could not but
possess People of old, when these Miracles
were wrought; and if the rais'd Persons
had told any Stories of their separate Existance,
the Evangelists no less unquestionally
would have reported them, in as
much as such a Report would have been,
not only a Confirmation of that Doctrine;
which is of the Essence of our Religion; but
an absolute Confutation of the <i>Sadducees</i>
and <i>Sceptists</i> of that Age, and of the <i>Materialists</i>
of this. But this their Silence in
this Case is of bad Consequence, either to
the Doctrine of the Soul's Existence in Separation
from the Body, or to these Miracles
themselves, since we must hereupon
almost necessarily hold, that these rais'd
Persons were not at all dead, or that their
Souls dy'd with them.</p>

<p>The Author of a Sermon, ascrib'd to
St. <i>Augustin</i> tells us<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> that <i>Lazarus</i> after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34_Book5" id="Page_34_Book5">[Pg 34]</a></span>
his Resurrection made a large Report of
<i>Hell</i>, where he had been: But as this is a
mere Fiction of that Author, without the
least Authority from Scripture; so I presume
it will be accounted a <i>Blunder</i> in
him, to suppose the Soul of <i>Lazarus</i>, the
Friend and beloved of <i>Jesus</i>, was in Hell.
The Soul of <i>Jesus</i> indeed, for Reasons best
known to himself, upon his Death, descended
into Hell, when some think he
should rather have gone, with the penitent
Thief, into Paradise. But the Thoughts,
that any of <i>Jesus</i>'s Friends should go to
Hell, I suppose will not be born with;
or what will become of the Preachers of
this Age, who would be accounted Men
or that Denomination. And if <i>Lazarus</i>'s
Soul had been in Paradise, it was hardly
a good Work in <i>Jesus</i> to recall it, for thirty
Years afterwards, to the Miseries and
Troubles of this wicked World. I wish
therefore our <i>Divines</i> could determine,
where <i>Lazarus</i>'s Soul was for the four
Days of his Burial; because I can't possibly
conceive any thing else, than that he
was not really dead, or that his Soul dy'd
with him, or went to a bad place, otherwise
after his Resurrection he had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35_Book5" id="Page_35_Book5">[Pg 35]</a></span>
absconded for fear of the <i>Jews</i>, as if he
was unwilling to die again, and return to
the Place from whence he came.</p>

<p>But however it was with the Souls of
these rais'd Persons before their Re-union to
their Bodies, here is another Difficulty and
Objection against these Miracles; and how
will our <i>Divines</i> get over it? Perhaps they
may say, that tho' these rais'd Persons were
before really dead; yet their Souls were
not as yet gone to their Places prepared of
God for them, but continued hovering
about their Bodies, like the Flame about
the Snuff of a Candle, with desires</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;<i>iterumq; reverti</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Corpora</i>&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to be again rejoin'd to them. And withall
my Heart let this Answer pass, if our
<i>Divines</i> and <i>Infidels</i> can so agree upon it. As
for my own Opinion, it is this, that these
Miracles of <i>Jesus</i> are Parables, and that it
was beside the Purpose of the Parable,
and of the <i>Evangelists</i> to say any thing of
the Place and State of the Soul upon
its Separation from the Body; otherwise
the Letter of their Stories is manifestly obnoxious
to the Objection above, or the
Deaths of these pretended rais'd Persons,
upon Christian Principles, are questionable.
But</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36_Book5" id="Page_36_Book5">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>6. And lastly, Let us consider the intrinsick
Absurdities and Incredibilities of
the several Stories of these three Miracles.
And such Absurdities shall we find in them,
that, if they had been intended as Testimonies
of <i>Jesus</i>'s divine Power, had never
been inserted in their Narratives.</p>

<p>As to <i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter, and her Resurrection
from the dead, St. <i>Hilary</i><a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
hints, that there was no such Person as
<i>Jairus</i> whose Name was fictitious, and
coin'd with a spiritual Signification for the
Use of the Parable; and he gives this
Reason, and a good Reason it is, why he
thought so, because it is elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
intimated in the Gospel, that none of the
Rulers of the Synagogues confessedly believed
on <i>Jesus</i>. Is not here then a stumbling-Block
at the Threshold of the Letter
of this Story? But why did <i>Jesus</i> say,
this Girl was but in a Sleep? If he was
going to work a Miracle in her Resuscitation,
he should not have call'd Death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37_Book5" id="Page_37_Book5">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<i>Sleep</i>; but if others had been of a contrary
Opinion, he should first have convinced
them of the Certainty of her Death, before
he did the great Work on her. And
why did he charge the Parents of the Girl
not to speak of the Miracle? If he meant
it as Testimony of his divine Power,
he should rather have exhorted them, in
justice to himself to publish it, and make
it well known. And why, as St. <i>Ambrose</i><a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
puts the Question, did he turn the
People out of the House, before he would
raise her? The more Witnesses are present
at a Miracle, the better it is attested,
and the more readily believed by others;
and who should be present at the Miracle
rather than those who were incredulous of
<i>Jesus</i>'s divine Power? Are not all these
Circumstances, so many <i>Absurdities</i>, which,
if they are not to be accounted for in the
<i>Mystery</i>, are so far destructive of the <i>Letter</i>,
as that it is Nonsense and Folly in our
<i>Divines</i> to talk of a Miracle here, against
<i>Jesus</i>'s express Word and Prohibition to
the contrary.</p>

<p>As to the Story of the Widow of <i>Naim</i>'s
Son, excepting what is before observed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38_Book5" id="Page_38_Book5">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the shortness of the Time, in which he lay
dead, and of the Unfitness of his Person
to be rais'd before an Husband and Father
of a Family, to the Comfort of his Wife
and Children, (which are enough to overthrow
the Credulity of the Miracle) I have
here no more Fault to find in the Letter
of it.</p>

<p>But the long Story of <i>Lazarus</i> is so brimful
of Absurdities, that, if the Letter alone
is to be regarded; St. <i>John</i>, who was then
above a hundred, when he wrote it, had
lived beyond his Reason and Senses, or he
could not have committed them.</p>

<p>I have not Room here to make Remarks
on all these Absurdities, which would be
the Work of a Volume; but shall single
out three or four of them at present, reserving
the rest for another Opportunity,
when the whole Story of this Miracle will
appear to be such a Contexture of Folly
and Fraud in its Contrivance, Execution,
and Relation, as is not to be equall'd in
all Romantick History; and our <i>Divines</i>
will find themselves so distress'd upon the
Dissection and Display of it, as that they
must of Necessity allow this Story to be
but a Parable; or, what's most grievous
to think on, give up their Religion upon
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39_Book5" id="Page_39_Book5">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p><i>First</i> then, observe that <i>Jesus</i> is said to
have <i>wept</i> and <i>groan'd</i> for the Death of
<i>Lazarus</i>: But why so, says<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> St. <i>Basil</i>?
Was not this an <i>Absurdity</i> to weep at all
for the Death of him, whom he could,
and was about to recover to Life again?
Another Man may as reasonably grieve
for the Absence of his Friend, whose Company
and Presence he can retrieve in an
Instant, as that <i>Jesus</i> should shed Tears
for <i>Lazarus</i> in this Case. If <i>Jesus</i> could
not or would not raise him from the dead,
he ought not, as a Philosopher, who knows
Man is born to die, to betray so much
Weakness as to weep for him. Patience
and Resignation unto God upon the Death
of our dearest Friends and Relations is
what all Philosophers have rightly taught;
and <i>Jesus</i>, one would think, should have
been the most Heroical Example of these
Graces; and how came he to fail of it
here? A Stoical Apathy had better became
him than such childish and effeminate
Grief, which not only makes him a
mean and poor-spirited Mortal; but is a
gross <i>Absurdity</i> and <i>Incredibility</i> upon
Consideration of his Will and Power to fetch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40_Book5" id="Page_40_Book5">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<i>Lazarus</i> to Life again. If there be not,
according to the Fathers, Mystery in these
Tears of <i>Jesus</i>, they are a foolish and unnatural
Prelude to a Farce, he was acting
in the pretended Resuscitation of <i>Lazarus</i>.</p>

<p>Some antient Catholicks, not being apprised
of the Mystery, were so offended
at these Words, <i>Jesus wept</i>, that, as <i>Epiphanius</i><a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
says, they expung'd them out
of their Bibles; and I wonder, they have
not, before now, disturb'd the Faith of
Ministers of the Letter, to the utter Rejection
of the Miracle.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Observe that <i>John</i> says, it was
with <i>a loud Voice</i>, that <i>Jesus</i> call'd <i>Lazarus</i>
forth out of his Cave. And why, I
pray, a louder Voice than ordinary? Was
dead <i>Lazarus</i> deafer than <i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter,
or the Widow's Son? Or was his
Soul at so great a Distance from his Body,
as he could not hear a still and low Voice?
Some such silly Reason as <i>this</i> must be given
for this <i>loud Voice</i> here; but how absurd
it is according to the Letter, Infidels
will judge, till Christians can assign a better.
The dead can hear the Whisper of
the Almighty, if Power go along with it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41_Book5" id="Page_41_Book5">[Pg 41]</a></span>
as soon as the Sound of a Trumpet. St.
<i>John</i> then should not have written of a
<i>loud Voice</i>, unless he meant to adapt his
Story to the Capacities and Conceptions of
the Vulgar, who have no Apprehensions
of God's Power, out of sensible and human
Representations of it.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Because that a Miracle should
be well guarded against all Suspicion of
Fraud, I was thinking to make it an <i>Absurdity</i>,
that the Napkin, before <i>Jesus</i> rais'd
<i>Lazarus</i>, was not taken from his Face, that
the Spectators might behold his mortified
Looks, and the miraculous Change of his
Countenance from Death unto Life. What
<i>Infidels</i> think of this Circumstance I know
not: I hope it is not with them a Token
of Fraud and Imposture; tho' I must needs
say, that if the Fathers did not let me in
to the Mystery of the Napkin about <i>Lazarus</i>'s
Face when <i>Jesus</i> call'd him forth, I
should not my self like it.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, and lastly, Observe, St. <i>John</i>
says, v. 45. that <i>many of the Jews, who
had seen the Things that Jesus did</i> here;
<i>believed on him</i>; and <i>some of them</i>, v. 46.
who did not believe, <i>went their Ways to
the Pharisees and told them what Things
Jesus had done</i> in this pretended Miracle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42_Book5" id="Page_42_Book5">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and how the Business was transacted:
Whereupon the Chief Priests and Pharisees
were so far incens'd as v. 53. <i>from that
Day forth they took Council together to put
him to Death</i>; and Ch. xii. 10. <i>consulted,
that they might put</i> Lazarus <i>also to Death</i>.
Jesus <i>therefore</i> (and his Disciples and <i>Lazarus</i>
fled for it, for they) v. 54. <i>walk'd
no more openly among the Jews</i>, but <i>went
thence into a Country near to the Wilderness</i>
(a convenient hiding Place) <i>and there continued
with his Disciples</i>; otherwise in all
Probability they had been all sacrificed.</p>

<p>I dare not argue upon these Circumstances,
neither would I, for the Honour
of <i>Jesus</i> have mention'd them; but that
my old Friend, the Jewish <i>Rabbi</i>, who
help'd me to the Satirical Invective against
<i>Jesus</i>'s Miracle of <i>turning Water into Wine</i>,
has hence form'd an Objection against <i>Lazarus</i>'s
Resurrection, and sent me a <i>Letter</i>
upon it, desiring me to publish it, and exhort
the <i>Clergy</i> to answer it; otherwise he
would clandestinely hand it about to the
Prejudice of our Religion: Whereupon I,
rather than Christianity should so suffer, do
here publish it, and it is as follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Sr.</i> When we last discours'd on <i>Jesus</i>'s
Miracles, I promised to send you my
Thoughts on <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection,
which I look upon as a notorious Imposture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43_Book5" id="Page_43_Book5">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and for the Proof of it, need go no
farther, than to the Circumstances of its
Story, which your <i>Evangelist</i> has related.</p>

<p>"If there had been an indisputable Miracle
wrought in <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection;
why were the <i>Chief-Priests</i> and <i>Pharisees</i>
so incens'd upon it, as <i>to take
Council to put both Jesus</i> and <i>Lazarus</i> to
<i>Death for it</i>? Where was the Provocation?
I can conceive none. Tho' the
<i>Jews</i> were ever so canker'd with Malice
and Hatred to <i>Jesus</i> before; yet
such a most stupendous Miracle was enough
to stop their Mouths, and turn
their Hearts: Or if their Prejudices against
<i>Jesus</i> were insuperable, and they
hated him but the more for the Number
and Greatness of his Miracles; yet
why is poor <i>Lazarus</i>, inoffensive <i>Lazarus</i>,
upon whom this good and great
Work was wrought, an Object of their
Hatred too? Your <i>Divines</i> are to give a
credible and probable Account of this
Matter, such a one as will comport with
Reason and Sense; or we shall conclude,
that it was <i>Fraud</i>, detected in this pretended
Miracle, which justly provok'd
the Indignation of our Ancestors.</p>

<p>"To say, what is all you can say, that
it was downright Inhumanity, Barbarity
and Brutality in the <i>Jews</i> to hate <i>Lazarus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44_Book5" id="Page_44_Book5">[Pg 44]</a></span>
as well as <i>Jesus</i>, will not do here.
Tho' this may pass with many Christians,
who are ready to swallow, without
chewing, any evil Reports of our Nation;
yet it can't go down with reasonable
and unprejudic'd Men, who
must have other Conceptions of human
Nature in all Ages and Nations, than
to think it possible, that a Man, in <i>Lazarus</i>'s
Case, can be hated and persecuted
for having had such a good and wonderful
Work done on him. And why
then was he hated and persecuted? I
say, for this, and no other Reason, than
because he was a Confederate with <i>Jesus</i>
in the wicked Imposture, he was putting
upon Mankind.</p>

<p>"But supposing, what is never to be
granted, that the <i>Jews</i> of old were so
inhuman, brutish, and barbarous as to
hate and persecute <i>Lazarus</i> as well as
<i>Jesus</i> for this Miracle; yet why did
<i>Jesus</i> and his Disciples, with <i>Lazarus</i>,
run away and abscond upon it? for they
v. 54. <i>walk'd no more openly among the</i>
Jews, <i>but went thence into a Country near
to the Wilderness, and there</i> Jesus <i>continued
with his Disciples</i>. Is not here a plain
Sign of Guilt and of Fraud? Men, that
have God's Cause, Truth and Power on
their Side, never want Courage and Resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45_Book5" id="Page_45_Book5">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to stand to it. And however
your Christian <i>Priests</i> may palliate the
cowardly and timerous Conduct of <i>Jesus</i>
and his Confederates in this Case;
yet with me, it's like Demonstration,
that there was a discover'd Cheat in the
Miracle, or they would undauntedly
have faced their Enemies, without Fears
And Apprehensions of Danger from them.</p>

<p>"Our Ancestors then, who unquestionably
detected the Fraud, were in the
right on't to prosecute with Severity,
the whole Party concern'd in it: And if
they had aveng'd the Wickedness of it
upon <i>Lazarus</i> as well as they did upon
<i>Jesus</i>, I should have commended them
for it. Whether such a monstrous Imposture,
as was this pretended Miracle,
happily discover'd does not call aloud for
Vengeance and most exemplary Punishment;
and whether any Nation of the
World would suffer the like with Impunity,
let any Man judge.</p>

<p>"For all the Reports of your Gospels,
it is unnatural to hate a miraculous
Healer of Diseases; and there must be
somewhat supprest about the Inveteracy
of the <i>Jews</i> to <i>Jesus</i>, or his healing
Power, if it was so great as is imagined,
must have reconciled them to him: But
that they should hate not only <i>Jesus</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46_Book5" id="Page_46_Book5">[Pg 46]</a></span>
raising the dead, but the Person rais'd
by him, is improbable, incredible, and
impossible.</p>

<p>"If Historians can parallel this Story of
the Malignity of the <i>Jews</i> towards
<i>Jesus</i> and <i>Lazarus</i> upon such a real Miracle,
with any Thing equally barbarous
and inhuman, in any other Sect or Nation;
we will acknowledge the Truth
of it against our ancient Nation: Or if
such Inhumanity, abstractedly consider'd,
be at all agreeable to the Conceptions any
one can form of Human Nature in the
most uncivilis'd and brutish People, we
will allow our Ancestors, in this Case,
to have been that People.</p>

<p>"Was such a real and indisputable Miracle,
as this of <i>Lazarus</i> is supposed, to be
wrought at this day in Confirmation of
Christianity, I dare say, it would bring
all us <i>Jews</i>, to a Man, into the Belief
of it: And I don't think it possible, for
any People to be so begotten, byass'd,
and prejudiced, as not to be wrought
on by it. Or if they would not part
with their Interests and Prejudices upon
it, they would have more Wit and
Temper, than to break forth into a
Rage against all or any of the Persons
concern'd in it. And, for my Life, I
can entertain no worse Thoughts of our
old Nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47_Book5" id="Page_47_Book5">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Supposing God should send an Ambassador
at this day, who, to convince
Christians of the Mischiefs and Inconvenience
of an <i>Hireling Priesthood</i>,
should work such a Miracle as was this
of <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection, in the Presence
of a multitude of Spectators; how
would your <i>Bishops</i> and <i>Clergy</i> behave
themselves upon it? Why, they would
be as mute as Fishes; or if they did
fret and grieve inwardly for the Loss
of their Interests; yet they would have
more Prudence (ask them else,) than to
show their Anger openly, and persecute
both <i>Agent</i> and <i>Patient</i> for it. Wherefore
then are they so censorious and uncharitable
as to preach and believe another
Notion and Doctrine of our
Ancestors?</p>

<p>"But if a false Prophet, for the subversion
of an <i>Hireling Priesthood</i>, should,
in spite to the <i>Clergy</i>, counterfeit such a
Miracle, and be detected in the Operation;
how then would Priests and People,
Magistrates and Subjects behave upon
it? Why, they would be full of Indignation,
and <i>from that day forth would
take Council to put</i> the Impostor and his
Confederate to Death, of which they
would be most deserving; and if they
did not abscond and fly for it, like <i>Jesu</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48_Book5" id="Page_48_Book5">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and his Disciples <i>to a Wilderness in the
Country</i> to hide themselves, the Rage of
the Populace would hardly wait the
Leisure of Justice to dispatch and make
terrible Examples of them. Was not
this exactly the Case of <i>Jesus</i>'s Imposture
in the Resurrection of <i>Lazarus</i>;
and of the Punishment he was threaten'd
with, and afterwards most justly underwent
for it?</p>

<p>"Mankind may be in some Cases very
obdurate, and so hard of Belief, as to stand
it out against Sense, Reason and Demonstration:
But I will not think worse
of our Ancestors than of the rest of
Mankind; or that they any more than
others would have withstood a clear and
indisputable Miracle in <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resuscitation.
Such a manifest Miracle, let
it be wrought for what End and Purpose,
we can possibly imagine, would
strike Men with Awe and Reverence;
and none could hate and persecute the
Author of the Miracle; least He who
could raise the dead, should exert his
Power against themselves, and either
wound or smite them dead with it.
For which Reason, the Resurrection of
<i>Lazarus</i>, on the certain Knowledge of
our Ancestors, was all Fraud, or they
would have reverenc'd and adored the
Power of him, that did it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49_Book5" id="Page_49_Book5">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"It may be true, what <i>John</i> says, that
<i>many of the Jews, who had seen the
Things that Jesus did, believed on him</i>,
that is, believed that he had wrought
here a great Miracle: But who were
these? the ignorant and credulous, whom
a much less <i>juggler</i> than Mr. <i>Fawkes</i>
could easily impos'd on. But on the
other hand, it is certain, according to
<i>Christian Commentators</i>, that <i>some of them</i> did
not believe the Miracle, but <i>went their
ways to the Pharisees and told them what
Things Jesus had done</i>, that is, told
them, after what manner the Intrigue
was managed; and complain'd of the
Fraud in it. How they came to suspect
and discover the Fraud, was not <i>John</i>'s
Business to relate; and for want of
other ancient Memorials, we can only
guess at it. Perhaps they discern'd some
motion in <i>Lazarus</i>'s Body, before the
Word of Command, to <i>come forth</i>, was
given; perhaps they discover'd some
Fragments of the Food, that for <i>four
days</i> in the Cave, he had subsisted on.
But however this was, they could not
but take Notice of the <i>Napkin about his
Face</i> all the while; which <i>Jesus</i>, to prevent
all suspicion of Cheat, should have
first order'd to be taken off, that his
mortify'd Countenance might be view'd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50_Book5" id="Page_50_Book5">[Pg 50]</a></span>
before the miraculous Change of it to
Life was wrought. This neglect in
<i>Jesus</i> (which I wonder <i>John</i> had no
more Wit than to hint at) will be a lasting
Objection to the Miracle. <i>Jesus</i>
was wiser, than not to be aware of the
Objection, which he would have obviated,
if he durst, by a Removal of the
Napkin, to the satisfaction of all Spectators
there present. Because this was
not done, we <i>Jews</i> now deny, there
was any Miracle wrought; and, whether
our Unbelief upon this Circumstance
be not well grounded, we appeal
to Christian Priests themselves, who
must own, that if there was a Miracle
here, the Matter was ill conducted by
<i>Jesus</i>, or foolishly related by his <i>Evangelist</i>."</p>

<p>"It is a sad Misfortune, that attends our
modern enquiry after Truth, that there
are no other Memorials extant of the
Life and Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>, than what
are written by his own Disciples. Not
only old Time has devour'd, but Christians
themselves, (which in the Opinion
of the impartial makes for us) when
they got Power into their Hands, wilfully
destroy'd many Writings of our Ancestors,
as well as of <i>Celsus</i> and <i>Porphiry</i>
and others, which they could not answer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51_Book5" id="Page_51_Book5">[Pg 51]</a></span>
otherwise I doubt not but they
would have given us clear Light into
a the Imposture of <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection:
But if <i>Jesus</i>, according to his own
<i>Evangelists</i>, was arraign'd for a <i>Deceiver</i>
and <i>Blasphemer</i>, in pretending to the
Sonship and Power of God by his Miracles;
in all Probability this Piece of
Fraud in <i>Lazarus</i> was one Article of the
Indictment against him; and what makes
it very likely, is that the <i>Chief Priests</i>
and <i>Pharisees</i>, from the Date of this pretended
Miracle, <i>took Council together to
put him to Death</i>, not clandestinely or
tumultuously to murder him, but judicially
to punish him with Death, which,
if they proved their Indictment by credible
and sufficient Witnesses, he was
most worthy of.</p>

<p>"As it is plain from the Story in <i>John</i>,
that there was a Dispute among the By-standers
at <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection, whether
it was a real Miracle or not; so it
is the Opinion of us <i>Jews</i>, which is of
the Nature of a Tradition, that the
<i>Chief-Priests</i> and civil Magistrates of <i>Bethany</i>,
for the better Determination of
the Dispute and quieting of the Minds of
the People, requir'd that <i>Jesus</i> should
re-act the Miracle upon another Person,
there lately dead and buried. But <i>Jesus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52_Book5" id="Page_52_Book5">[Pg 52]</a></span>
declining this Test of his Power, the
whole Multitude of Believers as well as
of Unbelievers before, question'd the
Resurrection of <i>Lazarus</i>; and were highly
incens'd against both him and <i>Jesus</i>
for the Deceit in it. And this was
<i>one</i> Reason among others of that vehement
and Universal Outcry and Demand,
at <i>Jesus</i>'s Tryal, for his Crucifixion. I'll
not answer for the Certainty of this
Tradition or Opinion, but as the Expedient
was obvious, so it has the Face of
Truth and Credibility; and for the
Proof of it, I need only appeal to Christian
<i>Priests</i> and <i>Magistrates</i>; whether,
under a Dispute of a Miracle of that
Consequence, they would not require,
for full Satisfaction, it should be acted
over again; and, if the <i>Juggler</i> refused,
whether there would not be a general
Clamour of People of all Ranks for his
<i>Execution</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Matthew</i>, <i>Mark</i> and <i>Luke</i>, who knew
as much of this Sham-Miracle as <i>John</i>,
had not the Confidence to report it;
because, when they wrote, many Eye-Witnesses
of the Fraud were alive to
disprove and contradict them; therefore
they confined their Narratives to <i>Jesus</i>'s
less juggling Tricks, that had pass'd more
current: But after the <i>Jewish</i> State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53_Book5" id="Page_53_Book5">[Pg 53]</a></span>
was dissolved, their judicial Records were
destroy'd, and every Body dead that
could confute him, <i>John</i> ventures abroad
the Story of this Miracle; and if
the good Providence of God had not
infatuated him, in the Insertion of the
Circumstances here observed, it might
have pass'd through all Generations to
come, as well as it has done for many
past, for a grand Miracle.</p>

<p>"Thus, <i>Sir</i>, have you a few of my
Thoughts on the pretended Miracle of
<i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection. I have more to
bestow on it, but that I would not be
tedious. There's no need to argue against
the other two Resurrection-Stories.
You know <i>omne majus includit minus</i>,
and if the greatest of the three Miracles
be an Imposture, the two less ones of
Consequence are Artifice and Fraud.
And rather than the Miracle of <i>Lazarus</i>
shall stand its Ground, I'll have t'other
Bout at it from some other Circumstances;
the Consideration of which will
make it as foolish and wicked an Imposture,
as ever was contrived and transacted
in the World; such a <i>wicked Imposture</i>
of most pernicious Consequence to
the Welfare of the Publick, that it is
no Wonder, the People, by an unanimous
Voice, call'd for the Releasement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54_Book5" id="Page_54_Book5">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of <i>Barabbas</i>, a Robber and Murderer,
before <i>Jesus</i>. I don't suppose these Arguments
against this Miracle will be convincing
of your Christian <i>Clergy</i>, who are
hired to the Belief of it. But however,
a <i>Bishop</i> of many <i>thousands</i> a Year
to believe, can't in Conscience deny,
that the Arguments above are a sufficient
Justification of our <i>Jewish</i> Disbelief of
it.</p>

<p>"If you, Sir, should write a Discourse
gainst the Letter of the Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Resurrection, I beg of you to accept
of a few of my Conceptions on that
Head, which, I promise you, shall be
out of the common Road of thinking.
Your <i>Divines</i> think they have exhausted
that Subject, and absolutely confuted
all Objections that can be made against
it, but are much mistaken. Sometimes
we <i>Jews</i> dip into their Writings on this
Head, and always smile with Indignation
at their foolish Invectives against the
Blindness of the Eyes, and Hardness of
the Hearts of our Ancestors. If they
would but favour us with a Liberty to
write for our selves, a reasonable Liberty,
which in this Philosophical Age we
don't despair of, especially under so wise
just and good a Civil Administration, as
this Nation is happily bless'd with, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55_Book5" id="Page_55_Book5">[Pg 55]</a></span>
would cut them out some more Work,
which they are not aware of. In the
mean Time I am your assured Friend,"</p>

<p class="signature">
<i>N.N.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>So ends the Letter of my Friend, the
<i>Jewish Rabbi</i>, which consists of <i>calm</i> and
<i>sedate</i> Reasoning, or I would not have
publish'd it; for I am resolv'd he shall no
more impose upon me with his ludicrous
and bantering Stuff, like his Satirical Invective
against <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracle of <i>turning
Water into Wine</i>, so offensive to our Godly
<i>Bishops</i>. And because it consists of <i>calm</i>
and <i>sedate</i> Reasoning, which <i>Bishop Smalbroke</i>
allows of, I hope his <i>Lordship</i> will
take it into Consideration, and write an
Answer to it, which I, without the Help
of the Mystery, can't do.</p>

<p>If the foresaid <i>Letter</i> be offensive to our
<i>Clergy</i>, who don't judge it meet that the
<i>Jews</i> should take this Liberty to write
against the Miracles of our Saviour, and in
Vindication of their own disbelief of Christianity,
I beg of them, for the Love of
<i>Jesus</i>, not to let their Displeasure be visibly
seen; because the <i>Jews</i> will then laugh
in their Sleeves, and perhaps openly insult
and triumph upon it: But if they will privately
acquaint me with their Displeasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56_Book5" id="Page_56_Book5">[Pg 56]</a></span>
at it, I'll promise them to hold no more
Correspondence with such <i>Jewish Rabbies</i>;
neither will I ever hereafter publish any other
Objections against <i>Christ</i>'s Religion and Miracles,
than what come from the <i>Hotentots</i>
and <i>Pawawers</i>: and then it will be
strange, if our dignified <i>Clergy</i>, of most
grave and demure Looks, can't solidly
confute the worst, that such ignorant and
illiterate People can urge against them.</p>

<p>And thus have I done with my Objections
against the Letter of these three Miracles.
If our <i>Divines</i> shall think there is
little or nothing of Force in them; then
an Answer, which I should be glad to see,
may the more easily be made to them.
As for my part, without being conceited
of the Acuteness and Strength of any of
the Objections, I think it impossible satisfactorily
to reply to them, without having
Recourse to the Opinions of the Fathers,
that these three Miracles, whether they
were ever litterally transacted or not, are
now but emblematical Representations of
mysterious and more wonderful Operations
to be perform'd by <i>Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>To the Fathers then let us go for their
mystical Interpretation of these Miracles.
St. <i>Augustin</i>, in his Introduction to a Sermon
on the Widow of <i>Naim</i>'s Son, says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57_Book5" id="Page_57_Book5">[Pg 57]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
thus, "There are some so silly as to
stand amazed at the corporal Miracles
of <i>Jesus</i>, and have no Consideration of
his greater and spiritual Miracles, signified
by them: but others who are wiser
can hear of the Things that <i>Jesus</i> did
on Men's Bodys, without being astonish'd
at them, chusing rather to contemplate
with Admiration his more wonderful
Works on Men's Souls; after the similitude
of bodily Miracles. And these are
the Christians that conform their Studies
to the Will of our Lord; who would
have his corporal Miracles, spiritually
interpreted: For He wrought not Miracles
in the Flesh, for the sake of such
Miracles abstractedly consider'd; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58_Book5" id="Page_58_Book5">[Pg 58]</a></span>
that, if they were surprising to some
Mens Senses, they should be more astonishing
to the Understanding of others,
who apprehend the spiritual Meaning of
them. And they who by Contemplation
can attain to the mystical Signification
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, are the best
Scholars and most learn'd Disciples in
his Church and School. And, (<i>speaking
of the Absurdity of Jesus's cursing the
Figtree according to the Letter</i>) presently
after says, that this he observ'd, that
he might persuade his Hearers to think,
that our Lord <i>Jesus</i> therefore wrought
Miracles, that he might signify somewhat
by them, which he would have his Disciples
to learn and consider of. Come
now, <i>says he</i>, and let us see what we are
mistically and spiritually to understand
by the Stories of the three Persons rais'd
from the dead."</p>

<p>There are two Ways, that the Fathers
took in the moral and mystical Interpretation
of these Miracles: One was from the
Number <i>three</i>, and their Difference in Magnitude.
According to which they said
with St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> that these three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59_Book5" id="Page_59_Book5">[Pg 59]</a></span>
sorts of dead Persons, so rais'd to Life,
are Figures of three sorts of Sinners,
whom <i>Jesus</i> raiseth from the death of Sin
to the Life of Righteousness. They who
have conceiv'd Sin in their Hearts, and
have not brought it forth into Act; are
figured by <i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter, who lay
dead in the House of her Father, and was
not taken forth to her Burial. Others,
who after Cogitation and Consent, pass into
actual Sin are figured by the Young Man,
carried towards his Grave. But those
Sinners, who are habituated and long accustom'd
to Sin, are like <i>Lazarus</i> bury'd,
and in a stinking Condition under the Corruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60_Book5" id="Page_60_Book5">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of it; whom <i>Jesus</i>, for all that,
with the <i>loud Voice</i> of the Pr&aelig;dication of
his Gospel, will call forth out of the
Death and Grave of their Sins to a new
Life. So does St. <i>Augustin</i> make these
three dead Persons and their Resurrections,
Emblems of the said three Sorts of Sinners,
who are dead in Trespasses and Sins,
and by the Power of <i>Jesus</i> quicken'd to a
Life of Righteousness. And to this Opinion
of St. <i>Augustin</i>, do St. <i>Ambrose</i>, <i>Eusebius
Gallicanus</i>, and Venerable <i>Bede</i> agree.
And according to this Notion of these
Miracles they descend to a particular Explication
of the several Parts of their Stories.
As to give you two or three Instances.</p>

<p>The People who were turn'd out of the
House, upon the raising of <i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter,
which is an <i>Absurdity</i> according to the
<i>Letter</i> are, says<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> <i>Bede</i>, a Multitude
of wordly and wicked Thoughts, which,
except they are excluded from the Secrets
of the Heart, are a Hindrance of the Resurrection
of a Sinner to a new Life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61_Book5" id="Page_61_Book5">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>The Bearers of the Young Man<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> to
his Burial are Vices, evil Spirits, H&aelig;reticks,
and Seducers; and the <i>Widow</i>, his
Mother, to whom he was restored, is the
<i>Church</i>, who mourns for the Death of such
Sinners, as are typified by that Young
Man.</p>

<p><i>Jesus</i>'s <i>weeping</i> for dead <i>Lazarus</i>, which
is an <i>Absurdity</i> according to the <i>Letter</i>,
is a Sign<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> of the deplorable State,
that habitual Sinners are in, enough to
excite the Sorrows and Mournings of good
Christians, who have the Spirit of <i>Christ</i>,
for them. And the Stone that lay at the
Grave of <i>Lazarus</i>, is<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> a figure of the
Hardness of the Heart of such a Sinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62_Book5" id="Page_62_Book5">[Pg 62]</a></span>
which must be taken away before <i>Jesus</i>
will call him to a new Life. So do the
Fathers moralise and allegorise every Minute
Circumstance of these three Miracles,
as any one, who will consult them, may
find, and save me the Trouble of a tedious
Recital of their Authorities.</p>

<p>But the other mystical Way of interpreting
these three Miracles is by making
them Types of three great Events at the
Time of <i>Christ</i>'s spiritual Advent. Accordingly
the raising of <i>Jairus</i>'s Daughter is
a Type of the Conversion of the <i>Jews</i> at
that Day, as <i>Eusebius Gallicanus</i><a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> and
venerable <i>Bede</i><a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> and others expound
it. By <i>Jairus</i>, the Ruler of a <i>Synagogue</i>;
is meant <i>Moses</i><a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>; and by his Daughter
is to be understood the <i>Jewish Church</i>,
which, being at present in a State of Spiritual
Death, will be revived and converted
in the Perfection of Time. And to
the mystical Resurrection or Restitution of
the <i>Jewish Synagogue</i>, call'd <i>Jairus</i>'s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63_Book5" id="Page_63_Book5">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Daughter, will <i>Jesus</i> come<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> at the
same Time he heals the Woman of the
Church of her Issue of Blood. And this is
the Reason that the Stories of these two
Miracles are blended together by the <i>Evangelists</i>,
with their synchronical Numbers
of the Age of the <i>Girl</i> and of the Disease
of the Woman; because they are Types of
that blessed Scene of Affairs at the Conversion
of the <i>Jews</i>, when the Fulness of the
<i>Gentiles</i> is come in. Concerning which
blessed state of the Church, <i>Origen</i><a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
says, <i>Jesus</i> wrought many Miracles, by
Way of Type and Figure.</p>

<p>Among all the Miracles that <i>Jesus</i>
wrought, and are recorded by the <i>Evangelists</i>,
I think, as far as I have had Occasion
to observe, the Fathers are most scanty
in their Interpretations of that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64_Book5" id="Page_64_Book5">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Widow of <i>Naim</i>'s Son: Excepting what
is before noted of his being a figure of a
Sinner dead in actual, tho' not habitual
Sin, I find very little. But if <i>Origen</i>'s
Comments on this Miracle had been extant,
I dare say he would have given us
this following Interpretation of it. This
Widow, he would have call'd the Church;
and her <i>only Son</i> or masculine Offspring, he
would have call'd the <i>Spiritual Sense</i> of
the Scriptures, which is now dead, and
that the <i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Letter</i>, who are
his Bearers, are for interring him within
the <i>Earth</i> of the <i>Letter</i>: But <i>Jesus</i>, upon
his Spiritual Advent will put a stop to the
Intention of such Bearers, by reviving the
<i>Spiritual Sense</i> of the Scriptures; and by
restoring it, like a <i>quicken'd Son</i>, to the
Comfort of his Mother, the Church; who
has been in a sorrowful and lamentable
Condition upon the Death and Want of
it: This, I am sure, would be <i>Origen</i>'s
Interpretation of this Miracle, which, if I
had Room here, by a little Circumlocution,
I could prove.</p>

<p>As to <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection, it is in the
Opinion of the Fathers<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> a Type of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65_Book5" id="Page_65_Book5">[Pg 65]</a></span>
general and mystical Resurrection of Mankind
in the Perfection of Time. But this
is a most copious Subject; and unless I
could here throughly handle it, I had much
better say nothing.</p>

<p>And thus have I done with the three
Resurrection Stories. If the <i>Convocation</i>,
next Session, would determine by an Orthodox
Vote, whether <i>Jesus</i> rais'd any
more, than the said three Persons, from
the dead or not; I would present them
with a new and more entertaining Chain
of Thoughts against these Miracles; such
a Chain of Thoughts, as, upon the Conclusion,
let them hold which Side of the
Question, they please, will necessarily induce
us to hold the mystical Meaning of
these Miracles, or to grant that <i>Jesus</i>
rais'd none from the dead at all.</p>

<p>My next and last <i>Discourse</i> on <i>Jesus</i>'s
Miracles shall be against the Letter of the
Story of his own Resurrection, in which,
if our <i>Bishops</i> will keep their Temper
and Patience, till I publish it, I'll cut
out such a Piece of Work for our <i>Boylean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66_Book5" id="Page_66_Book5">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Lectures</i>, as shall hold them tug, so
long as the <i>Ministry</i> of the <i>Letter</i> and an
<i>Hireling Priesthood</i> shall last. If <i>Christ be
not risen</i>, then, according to the Inference
of St. <i>Paul</i>, <i>is their Preaching vain</i>; and
why should the People be any longer
charg'd with the Maintenance of an ignorant
and idle Order of Men, to no Use and
Purpose?</p>

<p>If I had not had Experience of it, I
could never have believed that, for all the
ludicrous Nature of these <i>Discourses</i>, our
<i>dignified Clergy</i> could have been so foolish
or malicious as to prosecute me for an <i>Infidel</i>
and <i>Blasphemer</i> upon them. How a
Man may be mistaken in himself! I took
my self for a real Advocate for the Truth
of Christianity; and was so vain as to imagine
these Discourses tended to a Demonstration
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship: And tho'
the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i> may be of a contrary
Opinion, yet I am still so conceited of
my Ability to defend our Religion, that
I'll stake my Life against his <i>Bishoprick</i>,
which I'll not be troubled with, if I win it,
that he can't form an Objection against
Christianity, which I can't solidly confute,
and make our Readers merry too, with his
Weakness and Impertinence in it. But
perhaps it may be unbecoming of his
Lordship's Character, and against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67_Book5" id="Page_67_Book5">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Grain, to make an Objection to that Religion,
which he finds much <i>temporal</i>, as
well as some <i>spiritual</i> Comfort in the Profession
of; I will therefore descend to another
Proposal, <i>viz.</i> If he'll but publish
an Answer to the <i>Jewish Rabbi</i>'s Letter in
this Discourse, and vouchsafe me the pleasure
of a Reply to him; then (to save the
Civil Magistrate's Trouble) I will suffer
any Punishment that in his Clemency he
shall think fit to inflict on me, for what's
past. Oh, what a Hazard do I here run of
Life or Liberty!</p>

<p>Some Christians, in my Case, would
think it a sad Misfortune to be odiously
represented as an <i>Infidel</i> and <i>Blasphemer</i>;
but I, in Temper and Principle, despise
such Obloquies, Slanders and Defamations;
and would not give a Rush to remove
them, so long as I had the Answer
of a good Conscience that I was undeserving
of them: But considering, that it
is the Duty of a Christian to seek the Peace
and Friendship of all about him, and especially
of our good <i>Bishops</i>, who, in Compassion
to the Danger they think my Soul is
in, have taken zealous and laudable Pains
with the <i>Civil Magistrate</i> for my Conviction
and Conversion; I do here, for the
sake of a Reconciliation with their <i>Lordships</i>
and other good People, make a formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68_Book5" id="Page_68_Book5">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and solemn Confession of my Christian
Faith, which tho' I don't express in
the Words of the <i>Apostical</i>, <i>Nicene</i> or
<i>Athanasian</i> Creeds; yet will do it in such
Terms as will be a Demonstration that
at the Bottom I am found as a <i>Roch</i>. Be
it known then to all Christian People,
that</p>

<p><i>Imprimis</i>, I believe upon the Authority
of the Fathers, that the Ministry of the
Letter of the <i>Old</i> and <i>New</i> Testament is
downright <i>Antichristianism</i>.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, I believe upon the Authority of
the Fathers, that the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>, as
they are recorded by the Evangelists, <i>litterally</i>
understood, are the <i>lying Wonders</i> of
Antichrist.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, I believe upon the Authority of
the Fathers, that all opposition and Contradiction
to spiritual and allegorical Interpretations
of the Scripture, is the Sin of
<i>Blasphemy</i> against the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, I believe upon the Authority of
the Fathers, that the <i>Ministry</i> of the <i>Spirits</i>
or allegorical Interpretations of the
Law and the Prophets will be the Conversion
of <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69_Book5" id="Page_69_Book5">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Item</i>, I believe upon the Authority of
the Fathers, that the <i>Ministry</i> of the <i>Letter</i>,
and an Hireling-Priesthood have been
the Cause of the Infidelity and Apostacy of
these latter Times.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, I believe upon the Authority of
the Fathers, that the Spirit and Power of
<i>Jesus</i> will soon enter the Church and
expel Hireling-Priests, who make Merchandise
of the Gospel, out of her, after
the manner he is suppos'd to have driven
the <i>Buyers</i> and <i>Sellers</i> out of the Temple.</p>

<p>These are a few Articles of that Faith,
once deliver'd to the <i>Saints</i> of the primitive
Church, which I firmly believe, and
will earnestly contend for. Now I appeal
to the Christian World, whether a
Man of such a Faith, like Heart of Oak,
can be an Infidel or Blasphemer. Upon
this ingenuous Confession of my Faith,
which I make by way of Atonement for
my past supposed Errors and Offences, I
hope the <i>Bishops</i> and all good Christian
People will be reconciled to me.</p>

<p>St. <i>James</i> says, that <i>Faith without
Works is dead</i>, and how a Man ought to
show his Faith by his Works, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70_Book5" id="Page_70_Book5">[Pg 70]</a></span>
which Faith is an empty and airy Nothing.
Accordingly I am making what haste I can
to show the Sincerity of my Faith by
these my <i>Works</i> and <i>Discourses</i> of this Kind.
And by the Grace of God, I hope our
Bishops will find me as unmoveable as a
Rock in the said Faith.</p>

<p>According to the foresaid Articles of
this my Faith, I am so fully convinced, not
only of the Error of the <i>Ministry</i> of the
<i>Letter</i>, but of the Mischiefs and Inconveniences
of an <i>Hireling-Priesthood</i>, that,
having set my Shoulders to the Work, I
am resolv'd, by the Help of God, to endeavour
to give <i>both</i> a Lift out of this
World. This is fair and generous Warning
to our <i>Clergy</i> to sit fast, and look to
their own Safety, or they may find me a
stronger Man than they may be aware of.
And tho' I don't expect long to survive
the Accomplishment of so great and
glorious a Work; yet I am delightfully
ravish'd and transported with the Forethought
and Contemplation of the Happiness
of Mankind, upon the Extinction of
Ecclesiastical <i>Vermin</i>, out of God's House;
when the World will return to its <i>Primogenial</i>
and <i>Paradisaical</i> State of Nature,
Religion and Liberty; in which we shall be
<i>all taught of God</i>, and <i>have no need</i> of a
foolish and contentious Priest, hired to harangue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71_Book5" id="Page_71_Book5">[Pg 71]</a></span>
us with his Noise and Nonsense.
Which blessed State of the World God of
his infinite Mercy hasten, for the sake of
our Spiritual Messiah, Mediator and Redeemer
<i>Jesus Christ</i>. To whom be Glory
for ever, <i>Amen</i>.</p>

<p>hen <i>the following</i> Discourse
<i>was finish'd and
ready for the</i> Press, <i>I consider'd
to what</i> Bishop <i>the</i>
Dedication <i>of it would be
most acceptable</i> (<i>for I am
resolv'd that none but</i> Bishops <i>as yet shall
have the Honour of my</i> Dedications) <i>and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv_Book6" id="Page_iv_Book6">[Pg iv]</a></span>
I had not long ponder'd upon the Matter,
before I hit upon your</i> Lordship, <i>who must
needs be pleas'd with this</i> Discourse, <i>because
of the Advantage, that you, as well as my
self, in the End, will reap by it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> <i>Virtue of your</i> Professorship <i>at</i>
Oxford, <i>you</i>, my Lord, <i>are a</i> Moderator
<i>at theological Disputations, as I am here:
And whether the Execution of your Office
be as troublesome as mine is, I know not:
But if the Design of this</i> Discourse <i>takes
Place, we shall find that modern Controversies
about Religion are all vain; and
thereupon be</i> both <i>of us soon eas'd of the
Trouble of our</i> Moderations <i>at them</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> <i>may be</i>, my Lord, <i>you are not so
weary of your</i> Moderatorship, <i>as I am:
Besides, that you are better paid for your
Pains, your Disputants are more amicable,
and, in the midst of their Disputes, more
tractable: Tho' they may warmly contend,
at the present, for and against the Point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v_Book6" id="Page_v_Book6">[Pg v]</a></span>
in Debate; yet like</i> Lawyers <i>who are no
less zealous for their</i> Clients <i>in the Day,
they commonly agree to drink a Bottle together
at Night, and go to Bed, good
Friends. And this is very well done of
them.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> <i>my Disputants</i>, my Lord, <i>call'd</i>
Infidels <i>and</i> Apostates, <i>at whose Controversy
I have the Trouble, by the Appointment
of the Fathers, to preside, are more
stubborn, turbulent and refractory. What ill
Treatment they would give each other,
if it was in their Power, I know not:
But my</i> Apostates, <i>since they can't be
aveng'd on their Adversaries, are full of
Resentment against their</i> Moderator, <i>because
I am not altogether partial to their
Side; and how I shall escape their Indignation,
God alone knows</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> <i>the</i> Clergy, my Lord,

Moderator <i>of the Controversy; I have
shewn them all the Favour I can in it,
and would have brought them off with
Honour, but for a</i> little Flaw, <i>here discover'd,
in the Foundation of their Church,
which, for the Determination of our Disputes,
must be confess'd and granted</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> <i>your</i> Lordship, <i>upon reading this</i>
Discourse, <i>should be of the same Mind
with me, I beg of you to stroak the</i>
Clergy <i>into Temper, Patience and Compliance:
Tell them, they have been long
orthodox and glorious Victors over</i> Infidels,
<i>and that it would be now an Act
of Generosity to yield to them in a</i> small
Point; <i>upon which such a Pacification
would ensue, as nothing hereafter would
be able to dissolve</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> <i>I have another Favour</i>, my
Lord, <i>here to crave of you</i>, viz. <i>that
you would be pleas'd to persuade my old

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> <i>your</i> Lordship <i>will do me that Favour,

Obedience, <i>preach'd at the</i> Coronation:
<i>Tho' many may laugh at your Revival of
that Doctrine, saying the</i> Clergy <i>upon an
Occasion, which our most excellent</i> Sovereign
<i>will never give them, would again
have Recourse to their</i> Reserves <i>and</i> Distinctions;
<i>yet I say it was well done of
your</i> Lordship <i>to preach it, that the
Tongues and the Hands (to say nothing of

<h3>A SIXTH</h3>
<h2>DISCOURSE</h2>
<h3>ON THE</h3>

</div>

<p>ere goes my sixth and
last <i>Discourse</i> on <i>Jesus</i>'s
<i>Miracles</i>; the Subject
whereof is the literal Story
of his own Resurrection;
which, according to
the Proposition in Hand,
I am to shew to consist of Absurdities,
Improbabilities and Incredibilities. And
I hope our <i>Bishops</i> will quietly permit the
Publication of this <i>Discourse</i>, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_Book6" id="Page_2_Book6">[Pg 2]</a></span>
if I assure them that I mean nothing
worse by it, than to make way for the
understanding what the Fathers write
of the mystical Resurrection of <i>Jesus</i> out
of the Grave of the Letter of the Law
and the Prophets; of which mystical
Resurrection of our <i>spiritual Jesus</i>, the
Evangelical Story of the Resurrection of
a <i>carnal Christ</i> is but mere Type and
Shadow.</p>

<p>I am so far from designing any Service
to Infidelity by this <i>Discourse</i>, that I aim
at the Accomplishment of some of St. <i>John</i>'s
Apocalyptical Visions. The Fathers say
that a <i>Church</i>, built on the Letter of the
Scriptures, particularly on the Letter of
<i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, is <i>Babylon</i>; and that
antiliteral Arguments and mystical Interpretations
will be the Downfal of her.
Whether there is any Truth in this Opinion
of the Fathers, I am minded to
make the Experiment; and tho' I should
bring the old House of the Church over
my Head, and be crush'd to Pieces in its
Ruins, I can't forbear it: But however,
I would advise the <i>Clergy</i> to make Haste
and <i>come out of Babylon</i>, for Fear of the
worst; or they, who upon the Authority
of the Fathers are <i>the Merchants of
Babylon</i>, will <i>weep</i><a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> <i>and mourn</i> upon her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_Book6" id="Page_3_Book6">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Fall, because <i>none will buy their Merchandize</i>
of the Letter <i>any more</i>. Dear <i>Jesu</i>,
that such a <i>Student</i> as I am in the <i>Revelations</i>
of St. <i>John</i>, and an Interpreter of
them too, upon the Authority of the
Fathers, should be charg'd with Blasphemy
and Infidelity!</p>

<p>So to Work I went; and I had not
been long musing by myself, how to sap
this Foundation of the Church, before I
was sensible of my own Insufficiency for
it. Whereupon I sent to my old Friend,
the <i>Jewish Rabbi</i>, for his Thoughts on
this grand Miracle of <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection,
which he gave me some Promise of. But
I desired him to forbear all Ludicrousness,
Satire and Banter, for fear of Offence:
For tho' our <i>Clergy</i> liked Volumes of Jests
and Facetiousness, if they were discharg'd
against <i>Jews</i>, <i>Turks</i>, and <i>Infidels</i>; yet
when they were levell'd at <i>Ministers</i> of
the <i>Letter</i>, the <i>Case was alter'd</i>, as quoth
<i>Plowden</i>, and they were not to be borne
with. Therefore he was to remember
that Decency, Seriousness and Calmness
of Argument, required by the <i>Bishop</i> of
<i>London</i><a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> or I durst not print it.</p>

<p>In Compliance with my Desires he sent
me the following <i>Letter</i>, which, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_Book6" id="Page_4_Book6">[Pg 4]</a></span>
purg'd it of a few <i>Puns</i> and <i>Cunundrums</i>,
because all Appearance of <i>Wit</i>, as of <i>Evil</i>,
was to be abstain'd from, I here publish,
and it runs thus.</p>

<p><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p>According to your Request, I here
send you my Thoughts on <i>Jesus</i>'s
Resurrection, in which I shall be shorter
than I would be, because of the customary
Bounds of your <i>Discourses</i>.</p>

<p>The Controversy between us <i>Jews</i> and
you <i>Christians</i> about the <i>Messiah</i> has hitherto
been of a diffusive Nature: But
as the Subject of <i>this</i> is the Resurrection
of your <i>Jesus</i>; so, by my Consent, we'll
now reduce the Controversy to a narrow
Compass, and let it turn intirely on this
grand Miracle and Article of your Faith.
If your <i>Divines</i> can prove <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection
against the following Objections,
then I will acknowledge him to be the
<i>Messiah</i>, and will turn Christian, otherwise
he must still pass with us for an
Impostor and false Prophet.</p>

<p>I have often lamented the Loss of such
Writings, which our <i>Ancestors</i> unquestionably
dispers'd against <i>Jesus</i>, because of
the clear Sight they would give us, into
the Cheat and Imposture of his Religion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5_Book6" id="Page_5_Book6">[Pg 5]</a></span>
But I rejoice and thank God, there is
little or no Want of them, to the Point
in Hand. For I had not long meditated
on the Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection, as
your <i>Evangelists</i> have related it, but I
plainly discern'd it to be the most notorious
and monstrous Imposture, that ever was
put upon Mankind. And if you please to
attend to my following Arguments, which
require no Depth of Judgment and Capacity
to apprehend, I am persuaded that
you and every one disinterested, will be
of the same Mind too.</p>

<p>To overthrow and confute the Story of
this monstrous and incredible Miracle, I
was thinking once to premise an Argument
of the Justice of the Sentence denounc'd
against and executed upon <i>Jesus</i>, who was
so far from being the innocent Person, you
Christians would make of him, that, as may
easily be proved, he was so grand a <i>Deceiver</i>,
<i>Impostor</i> and <i>Malefactor</i>, as no Punishment
could be too great for him. But
this Argument (which I reserve against
a Day of perfect Liberty, to publish by
it self in Defence of the Honour and
Justice of our <i>Ancestors</i>) would be too
long for the Compass of this Letter; and
therefore I pass it by, tho' it would give
Force to my following Objections; it being
hard and even impossible to imagine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6_Book6" id="Page_6_Book6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
that God would vouchsafe the Favour of
a miraculous Resurrection to one, who for
his Crimes deservedly suffer'd and underwent
Death.</p>

<p>But waving, I say, that Argument for
the present, which of itself would be
enough to prejudice a reasonable Man
against the Belief of <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection;
I will allow <i>Jesus</i> to have been a much
better Man, than I believe him to have
been; or as good a one in Morals as your
<i>Divines</i> do suppose him; and will only
consider the Circumstances of the Evangelical
Story of his Resurrection; from
which, if I don't prove it to have been the
most bare-fac'd Imposture that ever was
put upon the World, I deserve for the
Vanity of this Attempt, a much worse
Punishment, than he for his Frauds endured.</p>

<p>I have sometimes wonder'd, considering
the Nature and Heinousness of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Faults, for which he dy'd, that our <i>Chief
Priests</i> and <i>Pharisees</i> had any Regard to
his Prediction (which was so like a Bambouzlement
of the Populace) that he was
to rise again the <i>third Day</i> after his Crucifixion.
There's no other Nation in the
World, which would not have slighted such
a vain Prognostication of a known Impostor.
Let him foretell with ever so much Confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7_Book6" id="Page_7_Book6">[Pg 7]</a></span>
his speedy Return to Life, I dare
say, any other Magistrates of ordinary Prudence
would have despised him for a presumptuous
<i>Enthusiast</i>: But, when I reflected
on the Imposture of <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection,
and of what pernicious Consequence
it had like to have proved to the
Peace and Welfare of our Nation, if it
had not been happily discover'd, my
Wonder here ceas'd; and I as much admire
now the Wisdom, Caution and
Circumspection of our <i>Chief Priests</i> against
all possible Fraud and Deceit in the foretold
Resurrection of <i>Jesus</i>. Tho' <i>Jesus</i>
himself, the Head of the Confederacy, and
prime Projector of the design'd Cheat in
the Case of <i>Lazarus</i> was cut off, yet his
Associates were still numerous; and it was
not impossible, but they might concert a
Project of a counterfeited Resurrection of
him, in Accomplishment of his Prophecy,
that might be of more fatal Consequence,
and tend to such Confusions and Distractions
among the People, as would not be
soon quell'd and quieted. Whereupon our
<i>Chief Priests</i> very prudently consider of
Precautions against Cheat here, and wisely
make Application to <i>Pilate</i> the <i>Governour</i>,
that proper and effectual Measures may be
taken against a false and feign'd Resurrection,
for Fear of the ill Effects of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8_Book6" id="Page_8_Book6">[Pg 8]</a></span>
And one of them, as the <i>Spokesman</i> of
their Company, seems, according to
<i>Matthew</i>, Ch. xxviii. to have made the
Speech following.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>SIR</i>, "We remember that this Deceiver
and Impostor <i>Jesus</i>, who was
yesterday crucified, and justly suffer'd
Death for his Blasphemy and many Delusions
of the People (that were of bad
Consequence, and might have been of
much worse, if he had not been timely
brought to condign Punishment) said
repeatedly before, that notwithstanding
the Death he was to undergo he should
rise again to Life the <i>third Day</i> after.
It is not that we are at all apprehensive
of such a wonderful and miraculous
Event, which knowing him to have
been a false Prophet as well as a deceitful
Juggler, we have no Fears nor
Belief of. But as it is not long since,
that the Inhabitants in and about <i>Bethany</i>
had like to have been fatally deluded
and imposed on by him, in the
pretended Resuscitation of <i>Lazarus</i>, one
of his Disciples and Confederates in Iniquity;
so it is not altogether impossible
nor improbable but his Disciples and
Accomplices, who are many, may project
a feign'd Resurrection of <i>Jesus</i> (in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9_Book6" id="Page_9_Book6">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Accomplishment of his Prediction) by
stealing his Body away, and pretending
he is risen from the dead. Should
such a Sham-Miracle be contrived
amongst them, and cunningly executed,
it would be πλανη (<i>not an Error but</i>) an
Imposture of worse Consequence to our
Nation and Religion, than the former
in <i>Lazarus</i> could have been, if it had
never been detected: We crave therefore
the Favour of your <i>Excellency</i>, to
give Command for the making his Sepulchre
sure, till the <i>third</i> Day is past,
that neither his <i>dead</i> Body may be taken
away, and a Resurrection pretended;
nor a <i>living</i> one slipt into its Place,
and a Miracle counterfeited on that Day,
when we will be present at the opening
of the Sepulchre, and give Satisfaction
to the People of his being a false
Prophet."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether <i>Pilate</i> was at all intent on the
Prevention of Fraud in this Case, or would
not willingly have connived at it, to increase
the Divisions and Distractions of our
then unhappy Nation, may be question'd:
But the Request of our <i>Chief Priests</i> was
so reasonable, and their Importunities so
urgent, that he could not resist them; and
therefore order'd them a <i>Watch</i> for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10_Book6" id="Page_10_Book6">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Sepulchre, which they might make as
sure, as they could, against Fraud and
Imposture, till the <i>third Day</i>.</p>

<p>Whereupon our <i>Chief Priests</i> deliberate,
what Measures were fittest to be taken to
this Purpose. And as I can't, and don't
believe any Man else can, devise any better
for the Security of the Sepulchre against
Fraud, than what they took; so I admire
and applaud their Prudence, Circumspection,
and Precaution in the Case.
They <i>seal'd the Stone</i> at the Mouth of the
Sepulchre, and placed a Guard of Soldiers
about it; which were <i>Two</i> such
certain Means for the Prevention or Detection
of Cheat in a Resurrection, as are
not to be equall'd by any other.</p>

<p>They <i>seal'd the Stone</i> of the Sepulchre,
which, tho' it was no Security at all
against Violence, yet was an absolute one
against Fraud. How the <i>Stone</i> which fitted
the Mouth of the Sepulchre, as a Door
does the Entrance into a Room, was seal'd,
I need not describe. The Use and Manner
of sealing the Doors of Closets, of Chests,
and of Papers is common; and as it is
an obvious Expedient, for the Satisfaction
of the Signators, against Deceit; so it has
been an antient as well as a modern Practice.
<i>Darius</i>, King of <i>Babylon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> seal'd the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11_Book6" id="Page_11_Book6">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Door of the Den of Lions, wherein
<i>Daniel</i> was cast, with his own Signet:
And wherefore did he so? For the Satisfaction
of himself and of his Courtiers,
when he came again to open and compare
the Signature with his Signet, that
no Art nor Artifice had been used for the
Preservation of <i>Daniel</i>. So our <i>Chief
Priests</i> seal'd the Stone of <i>Jesus</i>'s Sepulchre,
which they design'd to be present at
the opening of, on the <i>third Day</i>, the
Time appointed by <i>Jesus</i> for his Resurrection,
and then give ample Satisfaction
to the People, that there was a real, or
could be no Resurrection of his Body.
Wherefore else did they <i>seal</i> the Stone of
his Sepulchre?</p>

<p>Your <i>Grotius</i><a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> thinks, that <i>Pilate</i>'s
Seal was affix'd to the Stone of the Sepulchre;
but, as I believe, <i>Pilate</i> little concern'd
himself about the Prevention of
Deceit here; so I much question it. It is
more reasonable to think that the <i>Chief
Priests</i> and other Civil Magistrates of
<i>Jerusalem</i> with their several Seals, which
could not be open'd, but by themselves,
without Suspicion of Fraud, sign'd the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12_Book6" id="Page_12_Book6">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Stone, and intended to be present, on the
Day appointed, at the opening of the
Sepulchre; not doubting, what no body
could question, but <i>Jesus</i> would wait their
coming, and arise to Life, if he could, in
the Sight of themselves, and of a vast Concourse
of People, that were sure to attend
on them to behold the Miracle. Such a
Resurrection would have been of Satisfaction
to the whole Nation; and such a
Resurrection, reasonably speaking, <i>Jesus</i>
would, if he could, have vouchsafed in
Accommodation to the <i>sealing</i> of the
<i>Stone</i>.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this Precaution,
in sealing of the Stone, the best that could
be taken against Fraud, <i>Jesus</i>'s Body
was privately slipt off, early in the Morning
of the Day before, and a Resurrection
pretended by his Disciples; and you
would have us and our Ancestors to believe,
there was no Deceit in the Case;
tho' confessedly none of the <i>Sealers</i> of the
Sepulchre were present: Who can believe
it? Was, or can there be, any Imposture
more against Sense and Reason palm'd
upon the Understandings of Mankind?
If there had been a real Resurrection,
the <i>Sealers</i> of the <i>Stone</i> would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13_Book6" id="Page_13_Book6">[Pg 13]</a></span>
been the <i>Openers</i> of the Sepulchre; wherefore
else was the <i>Stone seal'd</i>?</p>

<p>A Question, that here arises, is, On
what Day, and what Time of the Day,
did our <i>Chief Priests</i>, the Sealers of the
Stone, expect, what they could not think
would ever come to pass, <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection?
Or what was the Extent of the
Time meant by <i>Jesus</i>, when he said that
after <i>three Days</i>, or on the <i>third Day</i> after
his Passion, he should rise again? If any
Impostor or Prophet like <i>Jesus</i> should in
this Age so predict his Resurrection, and
be executed on <i>Friday</i>, the Day for his
Resurrection would be presumed to be
<i>Monday</i>, and not <i>Sunday</i> Morning before
Day. And I humbly conceive former
Ages and Nations, and our Nation in
particular did compute after this Fashion.
Accordingly on <i>Monday</i> our <i>Chief Priests</i>
I don't doubt, intended to be present at
the opening of the Seals of the Sepulchre,
and to behold the Miracle: But <i>Jesus</i>'s
Body was clandestinely moved off early
on <i>Sunday</i> (the Day before <i>that</i> signified
and predicted for his Resurrection) to the
Laughter more than the Surprize of our
Ancestors, at the Notoriety of the Fraud
committed, and at the Vanity of a Resurrection
pretended upon it. And I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14_Book6" id="Page_14_Book6">[Pg 14]</a></span>
appeal even to your <i>Chief Priests</i> of the
Church, whether here's not another Note
of Cheat and Imposture; and whether
the Disciples were not afraid to trust <i>Jesus</i>'s
Body, its full time, in the Grave;
because of the greater Difficulty to carry
it off afterwards, and pretend a Resurrection
upon it.</p>

<p>But because your <i>Divines</i> (who have
singular Knacks at making two Nights and
a full Day, that <i>Jesus</i> was buried, to be
<i>three Days</i> and <i>three Nights</i>; and whose
various Ways of Computation I always
smile at) do assert that <i>Sunday</i> was the
<i>third Day</i>, on which, in Accomplishment
of <i>Jonah</i>'s Prophecy, and of his Own Prediction,
he was to rise again; I will suppose
so with them, and will, if they please,
grant that our <i>Chief Priests</i>, and the <i>Sealers</i>
of the Sepulchre, expected his Resurrection
on that Day, and intended, for the
opening of the Seals, to be present at it.</p>

<p>But at what Time of the Day were they
to come or could be expected at the Sepulchre?
Not long before Noon. But
<i>Jesus</i>'s Body was gone betimes in the
Morning, before our <i>Chief Priests</i> could
be out of their Beds; and a barefac'd Infringment
of the Seals of the Sepulchre was
made against the Laws of Honour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15_Book6" id="Page_15_Book6">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Honesty, and a Resurrection confidently
talk'd of by the Disciples; and yet your
Christian Priesthood at this Day would
have us to believe, there was no Fraud and
Deceit in all this! O most monstrous!</p>

<p>If our <i>Chief Priests</i> had trespass'd upon
<i>Jesus</i>'s Patience, and would not attend
at the Sepulchre for the opening
of the Seals, on the Day and Time appointed;
if they had been for confining
him longer in the Grave than was meet,
according to Prophecy, then his Resurrection,
without their Presence, had been
excusable and justifiable. But this his pretended
Rising to Life, not only a Day
before the <i>Chief Priests</i> could imagine
he would, or earlier in the Morning than
he should, for the Sake of their requisite
Presence, is, together with the Fracture
of the Seals against the Law of Security,
such a manifest and indisputable Mark
and Indication of Fraud, as is not to be
equall'd in all or any of the Impostures,
that ever were attempted to be put upon
the World.</p>

<p>In short, by the sealing of the Stone
of the Sepulchre, we are to understand
nothing less than a Covenant enter'd into
between our <i>Chief Priests</i> and the <i>Apostles</i>,
by which <i>Jesus</i>'s Veracity, Power and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16_Book6" id="Page_16_Book6">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<i>Messiahship</i> was to be try'd. Tho' we read
not of the Apostles giving their Consent to
the Covenant, yet it was reasonably presum'd
and could not have been refus'd, if
ask'd. The Condition of the seal'd Covenant
was, that if <i>Jesus</i> arose from the dead
in the Presence of our <i>Chief Priests</i>, upon
their opening the Seals of the Sepulchre,
at the Time appointed; then was he to be
acknowledg'd to be the <i>Messiah</i>: But if he
continued in a corrupt and putrified State
of Mortality, then was he to be granted
to be an <i>Impostor</i>: Very wisely and rightly
agreed! And if the Apostles had stood
to this Covenant, Christianity had been
nipt in its Bud, and suppress'd in its Birth.
But they had other Views, and another
Game to play at all Adventures. The
Body was to be removed and a Resurrection
pretended, to the Delusion, if possible,
of all Mankind, in which they have
been more successful than could be imagin'd
upon a Project that had so little Sense or
Reason, so little Colour of Truth or Artifice
in the Contrivance and Execution of
it. Our <i>Chief Priests</i> were apprehensive
at first of their stealing the Body away,
and pretending a Resurrection: But after
the <i>sealing</i> of the <i>Stone</i>, those Fears
vanish'd; because upon the stealing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17_Book6" id="Page_17_Book6">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Body, away against such Security and Precaution,
the Fraud would be self-evident,
and want no Demonstration and Proof of
it. But, for all this Precaution, I say, the
Body was in a barefaced Manner taken
away, a Resurrection talk'd of, and to the
Amazement of every one, who can think
freely, has been believed thro' all Ages
of the Church since. Upon the whole
then, I think, you may as well say, when
a seal'd Closet is broken open, and the
Treasure gone without the Privity of the
Signators, that there's no Wrong done; as
that in the Resurrection of <i>Jesus</i>, there
was no Fraud. The Cases are equal and
parallel. What then can your Christian
<i>Priests</i> say to this demonstrative Argument
of a manifest and bare-faced Cheat
in <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection? I have been
thinking, what they will or can say;
and upon the maturest Consideration I
don't find they can make any other than
one or more of these shuffling Answers to
it, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>1. That it was impossible for the Disciples
to steal the Body of <i>Jesus</i> away,
because of the Watchfulness of the Guards,
and therefore there was a real Resurrection,
tho' the <i>Chief Priests</i> and <i>Sealers</i> of
the Sepulchre were not present at it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18_Book6" id="Page_18_Book6">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>2. That, tho' the <i>Chief Priests</i> and
<i>Sealers</i> of the Stone of the Sepulchre were
not present, as I say they ought to have
been, to behold the Miracle; yet his
Resurrection was afterwards made as
manifest to them, as if they had been
there present.</p>

<p>3. That if <i>Jesus</i> did not really arise
from the dead, the Belief of his Resurrection
could never have been so propagated
at first, nor would have been retain'd
in the World for so many Ages since.</p>

<p>I can think of no other Answers, and
believe it impossible for your Christian
<i>Priests</i> to form any other, to the foresaid
Argument of Fraud in <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection:
But how weak, frivolous and
insufficient they all and every one are,
will appear upon a little Examination into
them.</p>

<p>1. Then, against the aforesaid demonstrative
Argument of Fraud, it may be
pretended, <i>That it was impossible for the
Disciples to steal the Body of</i> Jesus <i>away,
because of the Watchfulness of the Guards;
and therefore there was a real Resurrection,
tho' the</i> Chief Priests, <i>the</i> Sealers <i>of the
Sepulchre were not present at it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19_Book6" id="Page_19_Book6">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>To which I reply, and confess, that if
it was impossible to evade the Guards of
the Sepulchre, then there was a real Resurrection;
but if there was but a bare
Possibility of evading them, then this Answer
is of no Force. And I am of Opinion,
that the Thing was not only possible,
but easy, feasible, and practicable. Tho'
the <i>Roman</i> Soldiers were of as much Fidelity
and Integrity as any of their Profession;
yet it is well known, that such
Creatures are subject to Bribery and Corruption,
if the Disciples had any Money
to tempt them with: Or if their Faithfulness
to their Trust was untainted; yet
it is not improbable, but their Officers,
at the Direction of <i>Pilate</i>, who found
his Account in the Distractions of our Nation,
might give them the Hint to wink
hard at the Commission of such a Fraud.
But not to insist on either of these Ways
to evade the <i>Watch</i>; our Ancestors said,
what your <i>Evangelist</i> has recorded, that
the Disciples taking the Opportunity of
the Sleep of the Guards, carry'd the Body
of <i>Jesus</i> off; which was a thing both possible
and probable.</p>

<p>Of what Number the <i>Watch</i> did consist
is uncertain. Your <i>Whitby</i><a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> says they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20_Book6" id="Page_20_Book6">[Pg 20]</a></span>
were <i>sixty</i>; but he has no Reason nor Authority
to think, they were so many. If
they had been to be a Guard against Violence,
I could easily have believed they
were more; but in as much as they were
only a <i>Watch</i> against Fraud, and against
any casual defacing of the <i>Seals</i> on the
Stone, before the <i>Chief Priests</i> came to
open the Sepulchre, <i>three</i> or <i>four</i> Soldiers
were sufficient, and I don't think, there
were any more set to this Purpose.</p>

<p>It is not then at all improbable, that so
few Soldiers should be fast asleep at that
time of Night, or so early in the Morning,
when the clandestine Work was done;
especially after keeping such a <i>Gaudy-day</i>
as was the Feast of the Passover, which,
like the Festivals of other Nations, was
celebrated with Excess. Foot Soldiers
then, you may be sure, upon the Bounty
of one or other, did no more want, than
they would scruple to take their <i>Fill</i>,
which like an Opiat, lock'd up their Senses
for that Night, when the Disciples,
being aware of the lucky Opportunity,
carry'd the Body of <i>Jesus</i> off safely.</p>

<p>And where's the Absurdity to suppose,
that the Disciples themselves might contrive
the Intoxication of the Guards?
<i>Herodotus</i> tells us a Story of a Deadbody's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21_Book6" id="Page_21_Book6">[Pg 21]</a></span>
being stolen away by such an Artifice.
And I don't think the Disciples
of <i>Jesus</i> either so foolish or conscientious,
as not to take the Hint, and enterprize
the like Fraud. <i>Peter</i>, who,
upon Occasion, could <i>swear</i> and <i>curse</i>
like a <i>Trooper</i>, would hardly scruple to
fuddle a few <i>Foot-Soldiers</i>. But which
way soever it came to pass, the Watch
were asleep, which is neither hard to
conceive nor believe; and then the Disciples
executed <i>that</i> Fraud, which has
been the Delusion of Nations and Ages
since.</p>

<p>Your <i>Evangelists</i> would hint that the
<i>Chief Priests</i> gave Money to the Soldiers
to say, they were asleep, when the Disciples
stole the Body of <i>Jesus</i> away, as
if they were brib'd to a false Testimony;
but there neither was nor could
be any such thing. If there had been a
real Resurrection to their Astonishment
and Amazement, as it is represented in
your Gospels, no Money could so soon
have corrupted them to a false Witness,
being under such Fears of God and of
<i>Jesus</i>. I don't doubt but our <i>Chief
Priests</i> might reward the Soldiers for
speaking the Truth, and exhort them to
persist in it, with a Promise to <i>secure</i> them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22_Book6" id="Page_22_Book6">[Pg 22]</a></span>
against the Anger of <i>Pilate</i> for their sleeping
and Neglect of their Duty.</p>

<p>Here then is no <i>Answer</i> to the foresaid
Argument or Objection against <i>Jesus</i>'s
Resurrection. It was not at all impossible
for the Disciples, who stole the Body
away, to avoid the Guards, who were
and may reasonably be supposed to be
lull'd asleep, when the Disciples did it.
Neither is there any more Force in the</p>

<p>2. Second Answer to it, <i>viz. That tho'
the Chief Priests, the Sealers of the Stone
of the Sepulchre, were not present, opening
the Seals and beholding the Miracle; yet his
Resurrection was afterwards made as
manifest to them, as if they had been there
present</i>.</p>

<p>Ay, this is somewhat like an Answer, if
there be any Truth in it. A Manifestation
of <i>Christ risen</i> afterwards to our <i>Chief Priests</i>
would have been equivalent to their Presence
at and Sight of the Miracle. But
how was his Resurrection manifested to
them? did <i>Jesus</i> ever afterwards appear
personally to them, to their Satisfaction,
that he was the same Person, whom they
crucified and put to Death for a Deceiver
and false Prophet? No; this is not once
affected by your <i>Evangelists</i> or ever insinuated
by any antient or modern Writer.
How then was <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23_Book6" id="Page_23_Book6">[Pg 23]</a></span>
manifest to our Chief Priests? Why; your
<i>Divines</i> say, what is all that can be said
here, that the Words of the Disciples, who,
being Men of Honesty, Simplicity and Integrity,
would not lye, are to be taken
for it. Very fine, indeed! our Chief Priests
are to take the Words of the Disciples for
<i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection, and look upon them
as Men of Veracity, when they knew and
experienc'd them to be grand Cheats, not
only in stealing the Body of <i>Jesus</i> away,
but in the <i>known Imposture</i> of <i>Lazarus</i>'s
Resurrection, or your <i>Evangelist</i> had never
implicitly called it so. When therefore
Deceivers will not be <i>Lyars</i>; nor Thieves
<i>Dissemblers</i> of the Fact they are accused of,
I will own <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection to have
been manifest enough to our <i>Chief Priests</i>.
There's no need of more Argument here:
He that bellows more Words on it, loses
Time.</p>

<p>It has been a constant Objection of us
<i>Jews</i>, against the Resurrection of <i>Jesus</i>,
that he appear'd not personally afterwards
to our <i>Chief Priests</i>, to <i>Pilate</i> and to others
his Crucifiers and Insultors, to upbraid
them with their Infidelity and ill Treatment
of him. Whether <i>Jesus</i> would not
have done so, if he really arose from the
dead; and whether he ought not in Reason,
for the Conviction and Conversion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24_Book6" id="Page_24_Book6">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Unbelievers, to have done so, with me is
no Question. <i>Celsus</i> of old<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> in the
Name of the <i>Jews</i> made the Objection;
and <i>Olibio</i>, a late <i>Rabbi</i><a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> has repeated it.
But in all my Reading and Conversation
with Men or Books, I never met with a
tolerable Answer to it. <i>Origen</i> and <i>Limborch</i>,
the Writers against <i>Celsus</i> and
<i>Olibio</i>, gently slide over the Objection, as
if it was too hot or weighty to be touch'd
and handled by them. To recite the poor,
short and insufficient Answers of those
two Great Authors, to the Objection,
would be the Exposing of them, and
giving such Strength to the Objection,
which it don't want. Therefore I will
leave the Objection, which <i>Origen</i><a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
owns to be a considerable one, to the
Meditation of your modern Advocates for
Christianity; and when they can prove,
that <i>Jesus</i>, after his Resurrection did personally
appear to his Crucifiers, the <i>Chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25_Book6" id="Page_25_Book6">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Priests</i> and <i>Sealers</i> of the Sepulchre, to
their Confutation; or that, according
to the Law of Reason, he ought not to
have appear'd to them, then I will turn
<i>Christian</i>, and grant, that in the Argument
above, which proves plain Fraud
in the Resurrection, there's no Force nor
Truth. In the mean time <i>Jesus</i>'s Non-Appearance
to the <i>Chief Priests</i> is a Confirmation,
that he did not arise from the
Dead, but that his Body was stolen away,
or he would have waited in the Grave,
the coming of the Sealers of the Stone,
and their regular opening of the Sepulchre,
to the Conviction and Conversion
of all there present, and Confirmation of
the Faith of all Ages and Nations since.
But,</p>

<p>3. A third Answer to the foresaid Argument
of Fraud in the Resurrection of
<i>Jesus</i>, drawn from the Nature, Use and
Design of sealing the Stone of the Sepulchre,
is, <i>that tho' the</i> Sealers <i>of the Sepulchre
were not present, opening the Seals
and beholding the Miracle; yet</i> Jesus <i>did
certainly arise from the Dead, or the Belief
of his Resurrection could never have
been at first propagated by the Apostles, nor
would for so many Ages of the Church
since have stood its Ground</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26_Book6" id="Page_26_Book6">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Here's as little Reason in this Answer
as in either of the two former. Who
knows not, that many Errors in Philosophy,
and as many Frauds in Religion have
been sometimes accidentally, sometimes
designedly espoused and palm'd upon Mankind,
who in Process of Time become so
wedded to them thro' Prejudice and Interest,
that they will not give themselves
Leave to enquire into the Rise and Foundation
of them. False Miracles have been
common Things among Christians; and
as the Resurrection of <i>Jesus</i> is their grand
and fundamental one, so it is not at all
difficult to account for the Rise, Propagation
and Continuance of the Belief of
it.</p>

<p>Why it has been believed thro' these
latter Ages of the Church, is no Wonder
at all. The Priests had their Interest in
it; the ignorant and superstitious had their
Comfort in it; and the wise and considerate,
for fear of Persecution, durst not
enquire into the Grounds of it.</p>

<p>The only Difficulty here is to know,
upon what Principle, the Project and
Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection was at first
devised. And whether it was Ambition
or Revenge upon our ancient and Pharisaical
Priesthood, that prompted the Apostles
to it, is all one to me. Such bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27_Book6" id="Page_27_Book6">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Principles too often put Men upon desperate
Attempts. But however, an Imposture
it was, for the Argument above.
To say the Apostles and Confederates in
the Fraud, would not have stood to it,
and have dy'd for it, if the Resurrection
had not been real Fact, signifies nothing.
Many Cheats and Criminals, besides them,
have asserted their Innocencey, and deny'd
their Guilt in the utmost Extremity
of Death, without the like Views of Honour
and Fame. The only Thing that's
surprizing and astonishing in this Sham-Miracle,
is, that tho' it was the most manifest,
the most bare-faced, and the most
self-evident Imposture that ever was put
upon the World; yet it has been the
most fortunate and successful, having past
thro' many Ages and Nations with Reputation
and Renown; and might have
continued for as many Generations to
come, but for the Argument above,
that perfectly and clearly overthrows its
Credit.</p>

<p>But some may say here, where was
the Wisdom and Providence of God, all
this while, to suffer so many Ages and
Nations to labour under such a Delusion?
Why, I'll tell you; The Providence
of God in it was, "To humble
Mankind, in the End, for their vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28_Book6" id="Page_28_Book6">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Ostentation of Wisdom, Learning and
<i>Science falsly so call'd</i>; "To shame
them for their Madness and Wickedness
to persecute one another for different
Opinions in that Religion, whose very
Foundation is false and groundless; "To
caution them against a blind and implicit
Faith for the future; against believing
any thing out of the Sight and Reach
of their Understandings; "To admonish
them of the Necessity of Liberty to think,
speak and write freely about Religion, for
the Correction of Errors and Discovery of
Truth; and, lastly, "To reduce the
World, when it should be ripe for it,
to the golden Religion of Nature, which
upon the Testimony of our old <i>Cabalistical</i>
Doctors, and of your <i>Jesus</i> himself, is
the <i>End of the Law and the Prophets</i>.</p>

<p>And thus have I spoken to the <i>Answers</i>,
which your <i>Christian Priesthood</i>
may be presumed to make, to the foresaid
Argument of Fraud in <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection,
drawn from the Design of our
<i>Chief Priests</i> in sealing of the Stone of
his Sepulchre. I should not have concern'd
my self to speak to these their
supposed <i>Answers</i>, but to save them the
Trouble of making them, and the Imagination
of there being some Force in
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29_Book6" id="Page_29_Book6">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the Stories in your <i>Evangelists</i>
of <i>Jesus</i>'s several Appearances after his
pretended Resurrection, sometimes to the
Women, and at other Times to his Disciples,
I am not at all obliged to refute
them. If these Appearances had been
more frequent, better circumstanced, and
more solemnly averr'd, they would have
wanted no Confutation. There's no Doubt
on't, but the Disciples, who, for the Argument
above, unquestionably stole <i>Jesus</i>'s
Body away, in order to pretend a
Resurrection, would talk much of his
appearing to them, and of the Conversation
afterwards, they had with him.
And if they had told better and more
plausible Tales of their Sight of and Conversation
with him, it would be nothing
to the Purpose; <i>better</i>, I say, <i>and more
plausible Tales</i> than those upon Record,
which for Absurdity, Nonsense and Incoherence
carry their own Confutation
along with them.</p>

<p>Whoever blends together the various
History of the four <i>Evangelists</i>, as to <i>Jesus</i>'s
Appearances after his Resurrection,
will find himself, not only perplex'd how
to make an intelligible, consistent, and sensible
Story of it; but must, with <i>Celsus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30_Book6" id="Page_30_Book6">[Pg 30]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
needs think it, if he closely think on't,
like some of the confused and incredible
womanish Fables of the Apparitions of
the Ghosts of deceased Persons, which the
Christian World in particular has in former
Ages abounded with. The Ghosts of the
Dead in this present Age, and especially
in this Protestant Country, have ceas'd to
appear; and we now-a-days hardly ever
hear of such an Apparition: And what is
the Reason of it? Why, the Belief of these
Stories being banish'd out of Mens Minds,
the crafty and vaporous forbear to trump
them upon us. There has been so much
clear Proof of the Fraud in many of these
Stories, that the wise and considerate Part
of Mankind has rejected them all, excepting
<i>this</i> of <i>Jesus</i>, which, to Admiration,
has stood its Ground. It's no Wonder indeed,
that the <i>Clergy</i>, who are more incredulous
than other Folks as to Stories of
Apparitions, do stick to <i>this</i> of <i>Jesus</i>, the
only one excepted out of all others. It
is a sweet Morsel of Faith, and they readily
swallow and digest it, because they
live by it; otherwise this Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Appearances after Death had hardly
escaped the Fate of other Apparitions;
nay, would have been rejected one of the
first of them; there being hardly one,
I dare say it, among all the Stories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31_Book6" id="Page_31_Book6">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Apparitions, were they to be collected together;
that's more absurd and incredible
than <i>this</i> of <i>Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>I have not Room here to make any Remarks
on your Evangelical Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Apparitions after his Death; and if I had, I
durst not do it, for fear of an offensive
Ludicrousness, and of transgressing the
Rules of <i>Decency</i>, <i>Sobriety</i> and <i>Sedateness</i>
of Argument, you have confined me to.
But however; I can't read the Story without
smiling, and there are two or three
Passages in it, that put me in Mind of
<i>Robinson Cruso</i>'s filling his Pockets with
Biskets, when he had neither Coat, Waste-coat,
nor Breeches on. Sometimes I think
your <i>Evangelists</i> wanted Wit to adapt
their Tale to Sense, and to accommodate
the Transaction to Nature; and sometimes
I think them crafty, and were minded,
like <i>Daniel de Foe</i> in his aforesaid <i>Romance</i>,
to put the Banter upon the Credulity of
Mankind, with some disguised and latent
Absurdities, that, in the Conclusion and
Discovery, they might be heartily laugh'd
at for the Belief of them. I dare not,
I say, so much as hint at one of these
Absurdities, lest I should be unwarily
tempted to crack a Jest on it. But the
Time, I hope, is coming, when I shall
use more Freedom. And should your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32_Book6" id="Page_32_Book6">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Priesthood, in Proof of <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection,
urge any of these Stories of his
corporal Presence and Appearance after
it, then I trust, they'll permit me to
make as merry Descants on them, as
your <i>Bishops</i>, when Academical <i>Jesters</i>,
used to do on other Men's Bulls and
Blunders.</p>

<p>In the mean time I depend on the
foregoing single, sober and sedate Argument
of Fraud in this grand Miracle,
which I found on the Nature and Design
of sealing the Sepulchre; and for
Confirmation of my Opinion and Proof
of Fraud in it, will conclude this Letter
with a parallel Case and Story. Not
many Years since, one Dr. <i>Emms</i>, of the
Society of the <i>French</i> Prophets, who in
their Inspirations were, like <i>Jesus</i> and his
Disciples of old, Declaimers against the
Pharisaical Priesthood of this Age, did by
himself, or some of his Fraternity did for
him, predict his Resurrection on a certain
Day, when there was a Concourse of
People about his Grave in vain to behold
the Miracle, as there would have been
about <i>Jesus</i>'s Sepulchre, if he had lain
in it, his full Time. But supposing in
this Case, that the Magistrates and Priesthood
of this City, to prevent a Cheat and
Delusion of the People, had interr'd the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33_Book6" id="Page_33_Book6">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<i>Doctor</i> in a Church-Vault, and seal'd the
Door of it against the Day appointed for
his Resurrection, commanding a <i>Night-Watch</i>
to look to the Vault, that no Violence
or Deceit be used: This would
have been a wise Precaution against Fraud,
as was in the Case of <i>Jesus</i>. But what
if his Fraternity, having a Mind, like <i>Jesus</i>'s
Disciples, to bambouzle the People
and Priesthood, had, some of them drawn
the Watch aside to a <i>Gin-shop</i>, whilst
others carry'd the Body off, pretending a
Resurrection? What would all reasonable
Men have said here? That it was an
impudent and bare-fac'd Imposture. But
to carry on the Farce; supposing, the
<i>Doctor</i>'s Fraternity had afterwards averr'd
that they had seen and convers'd with him
alive, several Times, as before his Death;
and had told particular Stories of their
Conversation with him; as <i>first</i> of all,
how he appear'd to some of their Women
(who were admonish'd of the Certainty of
his Resurrection by a Youth or an Angel
or two, they could not tell whether,
but they were as like to Angels, which
they never saw before in their Lives, as
Youths could be) who knew him, not by
his Countenance, for <i>their Eyes were holden</i>,
but by his Talk on Scripture Prophecy,
which was his usual Cant before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34_Book6" id="Page_34_Book6">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Death. And at another Time he appear'd
to his old Acquaintance, who knew him,
not by the Features of his Face, but by
an habitual Motion and Action of his
Hand in <i>breaking of Bread</i>. And at another
Time he was corporally present, but
<i>they thought, they saw a Spirit</i>. About
<i>eight Days after that</i>, he appear'd among
more of his old Friends, but for all their
former Intimacy with him, some of them
<i>doubted</i> whether it was the <i>Doctor</i> or
not. At another Time he came to them
in <i>another Form</i> and Shape, unlike to his
pristine one, but they were sure it was <i>He</i>
by his Exposition of the Scripture. At
another Time, when they were assembled
together and the Doors were lock'd, <i>for
fear of the Clergy</i>, the <i>Doctor</i> slipt unexpectedly
into their Company, either from
behind a Curtain, or miraculously enter'd
at the Key-hole. And the last Time
he appear'd, there was one of his intimate
Friends had not known him, but by a
<i>Sore</i> in his Breast, which the Power of
God, in his Resurrection, did not heal:
After which, they said, he <i>vanish'd away,
was taken up into Heaven</i>, and they saw
him no more. Supposing, I say, the
<i>French</i> Prophets had told such like Stories
of <i>Doctor Emms</i>'s Resurrection and of
his Appearances to them; what would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35_Book6" id="Page_35_Book6">[Pg 35]</a></span>
your Priests and all other wise Men have
said to it? Why, that it was all idle
Tales, manifest Lyes, Sham, and Imposture;
and that if the <i>Doctor</i>, in Confutation
of the Errors of our Priests, had
risen to Life, God would have kept him
in his Sepulchre, his full time, and have
rais'd him in the Presence of Priests,
Magistrates and People; and that he
would have walk'd afterwards publickly
in the Streets without Danger, to the
Satisfaction of all, who knew him, that
he was the same <i>Emms</i> who died and
was bury'd: <i>Without Danger</i>, I say, from
the Populace, who would have been so
far from affronting him, that they would
have almost adored him for the miraculous
Favour God had done him, in his
Resurrection from the Dead; and that
he would never have skulk'd about, and
absconded himself for <i>forty Days</i> together,
before he was pretendedly translated;
and therefore there was nothing but notorious
Deceit and Imposture in all these
Pretences.</p>

<p>I need not make the Application of this
Case and Story, which your <i>Priests</i> know
how to do for me. To say here, that
there's none would be so desperate to engage
in such a Fraud, as is the supposed
Case of Dr. <i>Emms</i> above, is a Mistake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36_Book6" id="Page_36_Book6">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Many Thousands for their Diversion
would enterprise it; and the Stories of
the Apparitions of Ghosts, which are
almost all the Frauds of the Crafty to
delude the Ignorant, do prove it. I my
self would be forward to concert such an
Intrigue, if it were but to put the Banter
upon the <i>Clergy</i>, to ruffle their Tempers,
and secretly to laugh at them. Nothing
would deter me from it, but Fears
of the Civil Magistrate, which was not
the Danger of the Disciples of <i>Jesus</i>, because
<i>Pilate</i>, for the Sake of Rule over
the <i>Jews</i>, was a Countenancer of every
Faction amongst them; and particularly<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
<i>Tiberius</i>, upon <i>Pilate</i>'s Representation
of the Matter, soon commanded that
the Disciples of <i>Jesus</i> should not be molested,
nor call'd into Question: So the
Disciples stood to the Fraud, told the
Story of <i>Jesus risen</i> so often, till they
believed it themselves, and drew Multitudes
into the Belief of it: Which Belief
must have continued thro' all Generations
to come, but for my Argument of Fraud,
before urg'd and argued.</p>

<p>Here, Sir, before I conclude this Letter,
I think it my Duty however to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37_Book6" id="Page_37_Book6">[Pg 37]</a></span>
you my Opinion of the Religion, that
<i>Jesus</i> and his Disciples were for introducing
into the World. Tho' I believe,
what I have proved, his Resurrection, to
be a Piece of Fraud, and his other Miracles
to have been all Artifice; and tho'
our <i>Chief Priests</i> and ancient Nation are
justifiable in the Sentence, that was pass'd
and executed upon <i>Jesus</i>; yet I must
do him and his Disciples the Justice, to
own, that the Doctrine they taught was,
for the most Part of it, good, useful and
popular, being no other than the Law
and Religion of Nature, which, all Nations
being wearied with their own Superstitions,
and sick of the Burthen of their
Priests, ran apace into. Accordingly one<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
of your ancient Fathers says, that
they <i>who lived according to the Law of
Nature, were true Christians</i>. And I must
needs say, that if Christians, in Process
of Time, had not sophisticated this primitive
Religion of <i>Jesus</i>; if they had not
built their systematical Divinity upon
him, and brought strange Inventions of
Men into his Worship; if, lastly, they had
not again subjugated and entangled themselves
with another and worse Yoke of
Bondage, to an intolerable and tyrannical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38_Book6" id="Page_38_Book6">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Priesthood of the Church, the World
might have enjoy'd great Happiness under
<i>Jesus</i>'s Religion, even <i>that Happiness</i>
which is now only to be expected
upon a Disproof of his miraculous Resurrection,
that has been the Foundation of
a most confused Superstructure of wild
Doctrines and Opinions: Or more truely
speaking, <i>That Happiness</i> of the State
of Nature, Religion and Liberty, which
may be look'd for upon the coming of
our <i>Messiah</i>, the allegorical Accomplisher
of the Law and the Prophets; whose Advent,
upon the Tradition of our <i>Cabalists</i>,
will be towards the latter End of the
<i>Sixth</i> grand Age of the Creation, to remove
from our Faces and our Hearts the
Veil of the Letter; and in the mean
while I adhere to the umbratical Rites,
Ceremonies and way of Worship, derived
from our Forefathers.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, have I finish'd my <i>Letter</i> on
<i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection; and whether I have
not said enough to justify our <i>Jewish</i>
Disbelief of that Miracle, let your <i>Chief
Priests</i> judge. I don't expect my Argument
against it will be convincing of
any of your Preachers. They have a
potent Reason for their Faith, which
we <i>Jews</i> can't come at; or I don't know
but we might believe with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39_Book6" id="Page_39_Book6">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>I trust you'll meet with no Molestation
for the Publication of this <i>Letter</i>;
neither do I think, it was any thing of
mine, inserted in your Discourses, that
at any time brought Trouble on you.
It was your own Imprudence to rave,
as you do, against <i>Ecclesiasticks</i>. What
need had you to talk of the Mischiefs
and Inconveniences of an Hireling Priesthood?
What Occasion had you to call
them Ecclesiastical Vermin, and to speak
of the Happiness of Mankind upon their
Extinction? These things are very provoking.
And here's the true Source, in
my Opinion, of all your Troubles!</p>

<p>Tho' I have here shewn, that <i>Christ is
not risen</i>, yet I have more Wit than to
make the Inference of St. <i>Paul</i>, that <i>their
Preaching is vain</i>. Their Oratory is
still useful, if it be but to tickle the Ears
and amuse the Understandings of the People
about Doctrines they underhand not,
whether true or false. And such an
Order of Men, as are your Priesthood, are,
by their Habit of long Robes, an Ornament
to Society; and it is an Honour to
the Country to have them well fed and
clad. Had I Room for it, I could write a
curious <i>Encomium</i> in Praise of them, and
tell the World of what Use and Advantage
they have been, in all Ages. O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40_Book6" id="Page_40_Book6">[Pg 40]</a></span>
what Wars and Persecutions might have
been rais'd in the World, but for their
pacifick Tempers! How would Sin and
Immorality have broke in upon Mankind,
like a Deluge, but for the Goodness
of their Lives, and the Excellency of their
Precepts! How has the Increase and Multitude
of their warm Sermons been the
Ruin of <i>Satan</i>'s hot and divided Kingdom
of Darkness and Error! It's owing to
their Pains and Labours, that every Age,
for many past, has been improving in Virtue,
till the present, which for Piety and
good Morals is that perfection of Time,
which is not to be meliorated but by the
Restitution of the golden Age.</p>

<p>So could I enlarge in Praise of your
<i>Clergy</i>; and so should you have done;
and then you might have disputed, as
you do, against any Doctrines, Miracles
and Articles of Faith, without Molestation.
Try, if you can't correct that fundamental
Error, you have committed.
Assert still, if you can, with Dr. <i>Rogers</i>,
the Necessity of an establish'd Priesthood,
well paid, for the Service of the <i>King</i> and
the Country, under all Changes of Religion;
which may be a Means to retrieve
their Favour, and will beget in me a
better Opinion of your Prudence, than at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41_Book6" id="Page_41_Book6">[Pg 41]</a></span>
present is entertain'd by your <i>Assured
Friend</i> N. N.</p>

<p>So ends the Letter of my Friend, the
<i>Jewish Rabbi</i>, in which, to my Comfort,
he has conform'd himself to the Rules of
<i>Sedateness</i>, <i>Decency</i> and <i>Sobriety</i> of Argument,
prescrib'd by the two great <i>Bishops</i>
of <i>London</i> and St. <i>David</i>'s. If the Weight
and Solidity of his Argument don't grieve
the <i>Clergy</i>, I am in no Pain for the Levity
and Ludicrousness of it. And whether
the Weight and Nature of his Argument
against <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection will at all
startle and surprize them, I know not; but
I profess for my self, that I might have
study'd long enough for such an Argument
against it, as this <i>Rabbi</i>, with his great
grey Beard, has presently hit of. He told
me beforehand, that his Thoughts on <i>Jesus</i>'s
Resurrection should be out of the
common Road of thinking; and I must needs
say, he has been as good as his Word, or
no Man ever kept his Promise.</p>

<p>There are two Things very remarkable
in his Argument: The <i>one</i> is, the
Use and Design of sealing the Stone of
<i>Jesus</i>'s Sepulchre, which he lays great
Stress on, to the Proof of Fraud in his
Resurrection; and the <i>other</i> is, his Application
of these Words, <i>the last Error</i> (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42_Book6" id="Page_42_Book6">[Pg 42]</a></span>
as he reads Deceit or Imposture) <i>will be
worse than the first</i> or former, in which
he makes the <i>Chief Priests</i> in their Speech
to <i>Pilate</i>, to refer to <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection
as the former known Imposture. If
his Application be just and true, the Consequence
is, that the Resurrections of
<i>Jesus</i> and <i>Lazarus</i> are both Impostures.
It grieves me to the Heart to think of
this Consequence, which our <i>Divines</i> are
to see to, and evade, if they can. No
sooner did I read his Application of the
foresaid Words, but I run to our <i>Commentators</i>
for another and better Exposition of
them: But alas! to my Sorrow, they
made nothing of them, but a sort of
a <i>proverbial Expression</i>, which the <i>Chief
Priests</i> must have spoil'd and knock'd out
of Joint. Being then under great Trouble
for the Truth of Christianity, and the
Certainty of these two grand Miracles, I
refer the Matter to our Learned <i>Clergy</i>,
desiring them to be as speedy as they can
in another and more proper Interpretation
of the foresaid Words, or <i>Jews</i> and
<i>Infidels</i> will run away with them in the
<i>Rabbi</i>'s Sense, to the Confutation of our
holy Religion.</p>

<p>I consider'd lately, that <i>Easter</i> drew
nigh, when it was usual for our <i>Divines</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43_Book6" id="Page_43_Book6">[Pg 43]</a></span>
in their Pulpits, to insist on the Proof of
<i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection; and therefore I
hasten'd the Publication of this <i>Discourse</i>,
that they might have these two peculiar
Texts, <i>viz.</i> of <i>sealing the Stone</i> of the
Sepulchre, and of <i>the last Error</i> or Imposture
<i>will be worse than the first</i>, to treat
on. He that produces a Sermon or Sermons,
wresting the foresaid Texts out of
the Hands of my <i>Rabbi</i>, and putting another
Sense on them, to the Credit of
<i>Jesus</i>'s and <i>Lazarus</i>'s Resurrection,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Erit mihi magnus Apollo</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and by my Consent shall be the next
<i>Arch-Bishop</i> of <i>Canterbury</i>.</p>

<p>But my Heart aches a little for our
<i>Divines</i>, and I almost despair of their
clean Solutions of the foresaid two Difficulties.
What must they do then? Why,
they must give up their <i>Religion</i> as well
as their <i>Church</i>, or go along with me
to the Fathers for their mystical Interpretation
of the whole Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection.</p>

<p>That the Fathers, without questioning
their Belief of <i>Jesus</i>'s corporal Resurrection
universally interpreted the Story
and every Part of it mystically, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44_Book6" id="Page_44_Book6">[Pg 44]</a></span>
most certain. St. <i>Hilary</i><a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> enumerates
many Particulars of the Story, and intimates
what they are typical and figurative
of, as any one may see by the Citation
referr'd to, which I have not Room
to translate and illustrate.</p>

<p>St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> says, that <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection
from the Dead at that time, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45_Book6" id="Page_45_Book6">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to exhibit an Image and Resemblance of
his future and mystical Resurrection. And
elsewhere says<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> that it's a holy Pleasure
to consider and search for the things
signified by the Story of it.</p>

<p>That <i>Origen</i> is of the same Opinion, no
body need question. A Multitude of his
Testimonies might be produced to this
Purpose, but I shall mention only one<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>,
wherein he asserts, that by the Sepulchre
of <i>Jesus</i> is to be understood the
<i>Letter</i> of the Scriptures, in which, as in
a Rock, he is reposited.</p>

<p>St. <i>John</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i><a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> by the Crucifiers
of <i>Jesus</i> understands false Teachers,
meaning <i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Letter</i> to be
sure, because he himself was a great Allegorist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46_Book6" id="Page_46_Book6">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>St. <i>Hilary</i> says that<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> <i>Barabbas</i> is a
Type of <i>Antichrist</i>; and by <i>Antichrist</i>, as
I have elsewhere shewn out of the Fathers,
is meant the <i>Letter</i> of the Scriptures,
which modern Commentators and
Crucifiers of <i>Jesus</i> would prefer to the
Spirit. For these are the two, <i>Letter</i> and
Spirit, the <i>Christ</i> and <i>Antichrist</i>, that are
contrary one to another.</p>

<p>St. <i>Jerom</i><a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> says, that by the <i>Vail</i> of
the <i>Temple</i> rent at <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection,
is to be understood the opening the <i>Vail</i>
of the <i>Letter</i> of the Law and the Prophets
for the Manifestation of the divine Mysteries
contain'd in them. And by the rending
of the Rocks according<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> to him is
to be understood the Apertion of the Oracles
of God, that were before as hard as a
Rock, till his spiritual Resurrection for the
Illustration of them. And by the Earthquake,
He says is meant the Shaking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47_Book6" id="Page_47_Book6">[Pg 47]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
Hearts of Men, and preparing them,
by a Dereliction of their old Errors, for
the Susception of the true Knowledge of
God.</p>

<p>As to the Time that <i>Jesus</i> was dead and
bury'd, which modern <i>Divines</i> call <i>three
Days</i> and <i>three Nights</i>, St. <i>Augustin</i> says<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
that according to the Scripture he was
not so long dead and buried. Many, says<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
he, have put various Constructions
on the Time of <i>Christ</i>'s Burial, endeavouring
to make three Days of it: But
we, without slighting any of their Opinions,
are for a mystical Interpretation,
and suppose, that by the three Days are
to be understood Three Ages of the
World.</p>

<p>The Day would fail me to collect all
the Passages out of the Fathers, in Interpretation
of one or other of the Parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48_Book6" id="Page_48_Book6">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of the Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection, but
what I have here said in a few Citations,
is enough to show, that they look'd upon
the whole Story, as emblematical of his
spiritual Resurrection out of the <i>Grave</i>
of the <i>Letter</i> of the Scriptures, in which
he has been buried about <i>three Days</i> and
<i>three Nights</i>, according to that mystical
Interpretation of prophetical Numbers
which I have learn'd of them.</p>

<p>And thus have I done with the Miracle
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection, which, by
the Help of my Friend the Jewish <i>Rabbi</i>,
I have shewn, according to the Letter, to
consist of the greatest Incredibilities. And
with this I conclude my <i>Discourses</i> on
his Miracles, intending to treat on no
more of them, unless I am invited or
provoked to it. I had once an Inclination
to make another <i>Discourse</i> on <i>Jesus</i>'s
miraculous Conception, and on his feeding
his Thousands, in the Wilderness, with a
few Loaves and Fishes; but upon a little
Consideration on the Letter of those two
Stories, I found myself too grave for the
Work; and my <i>Rabbi</i>'s Thoughts are too
gay and wanton; therefore it must be
omitted, till the <i>Clergy</i> importune me to
it, and signify their Curiosity to see it
perform'd by me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49_Book6" id="Page_49_Book6">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>My Discourses hereafter, if God spare
me Life and Liberty, which under his Providence
I don't despair of, to publish another
Volume, shall treat on some historical
Passages of the New Testament, such as,
"On the Stories of <i>Jesus</i>'s Birth; and
the Appearances of Angels to the Shepherds
keeping Watch over their Flocks
by Night: "The Journey and Presents
of the Wise Men to <i>Jesus</i>: "The Slaughter
of the Innocents at <i>Bethlehem</i>, and of
<i>Herod</i>'s Cruelty: "The Travels of <i>Joseph</i>
with the Child <i>Jesus</i> and his Mother into
<i>Egypt</i>: "The Disputation of <i>Jesus</i>
with the <i>Doctors</i> in the Temple, and
his Elopement from his Parents: "His
riding on an Ass to <i>Jerusalem</i>; and on
other such like Passages of his Life. For
I am resolv'd to give the Letter of the
Scripture no Rest, so long as God gives
me Life and Abilities to attack it. <i>Origen</i><a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
<i>says</i>, that <i>when we dispute against
Ministers of the Letter, we must select
some historical Parts of Scripture, which
they understand literally, and shew that
according to the Letter, they can't stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50_Book6" id="Page_50_Book6">[Pg 50]</a></span>
their Ground, but imply Absurdities and
Nonsense</i>. And how then is such a Work
to be perform'd to best Advantage? Is it
to be done in a grave, sedate, and serious
Manner? No, I think Ridicule should
here take Place of sober Reasoning, as
the more proper and effectual Means to
cure Men of their foolish Faith and absurd
Notions. As no wise Man hardly
ever reprehends a Blunderbuss for his
Bull, any other way, than by laughing
at him; so the Asserters of nonsensical
Notions in Theology should, if possible,
be satirized and jetted upon, or they'll
never be put out of Countenance for, nor
desert their absurd Doctrines. And there
never was a polemical Divine, that, if he
had an Opportunity and Advantage over
the Weakness of his Adversary, did not
take such a ludicrous and merry Course
with him.</p>

<p>But on such historical Passages of the
Gospel as before mention'd, do I trust to
publish another Volume of <i>Discourses</i>,
like to these on <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles; and at
present pass to my third general Head, at
first proposed to be spoken to, and that is,</p>

<p>III. To consider what <i>Jesus</i> means,
when he appeals to his Works and Miracles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51_Book6" id="Page_51_Book6">[Pg 51]</a></span>
as to a Testimony and Witness of his Authority;
and to show that he did not properly
and ultimately refer to these done in
the <i>Flesh</i>, but to those mystical ones he
would do in the <i>Spirit</i>, of which those
done in the Flesh are but mere Types and
Shadows.</p>

<p>And on this Head I shall be short, there
being no Occasion of many Words on it.
The <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i><a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> has collected
many Sayings of <i>Jesus</i>, wherein he seems
to appeal to the Works he then did and had
done in Flesh, as to a Witness of him. But
why might not <i>Jesus</i> then prophesy, and
mean the spiritual Works which <i>He-in-us</i>
would do? It is the known Way of the
Prophets to speak of Things to come, as
if they were already past, because such Prophecies
are not to be understood, till their
Accomplishment: Even so did <i>Jesus</i> prophesy,
when he appeal'd to his Works, as
I could prove from the Nature and Manner
of his Expressions, but that the Argument
would be dry and tedious: And therefore
I refer the Matter entirely to the Fathers,
who asserted that <i>Jesus</i> prophesied
in his <i>Miracles</i> as well as in his <i>Parables</i>,
and that the Works he then did in the Flesh
were but Types of his mysterious Operations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52_Book6" id="Page_52_Book6">[Pg 52]</a></span>
that would be the Demonstration of
his Authority and Messiahship. Hence it
is that <i>Origen</i><a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> says that <i>Jesus</i>'s first
coming was but a Type and Shadow of
his spiritual Advent and that his<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> true
Miracles, by which his Authority is to be
proved, are spiritual: Hence it is that
St. <i>Hilary</i> repeatedly says<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> that <i>Jesus</i>'s
Works were significative and predictive of
mysterious Operations, which we were
especially to look to. And Hence it is that
all the other Fathers interpreted the Miracles
of <i>Jesus</i> in a mystical and allegorical
Sense.</p>

<p>The Question then is, to what Miracles
did <i>Jesus</i> truly and properly appeal, in
the Opinion of the Fathers, for his Authority
and Messiahship? Was it to the Typical
or Antitypal Works? was it to the <i>Shadow</i>
or to the <i>Substance</i> of his Operations?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53_Book6" id="Page_53_Book6">[Pg 53]</a></span>
To his substantial Operations, to be sure,
which are and will be his spiritual ones
upon the Soul, that are greater than those
once done on Men's Bodies, and which
will be a proper Proof of his divine Power.
And to declare my Opinion freely, I am
only for such a spiritual <i>Messiah</i>, who will
cure the <i>Errors</i> call'd the Diseases of Mankind,
which <i>Jesus</i> of <i>Nazareth</i> has not
as yet done.</p>

<p>But not to dispute this Point with <i>Bishop
Gibson</i>, I will leave him in the Enjoyment
of his Opinion of his literal <i>Messiah</i>,
and miraculous Operator on Men's Bodies;
if he'll but indulge me in the Belief of my
spiritual <i>Messiah</i> to come for the healing of
modern Distempers call'd the Sins and Errors
of Mankind. And in the mean time
let us draw the Comparison between his
<i>literal</i> and my <i>spiritual</i> Jesus; and let the
World judge, to whom the Preference is
to be given for Power and Authority.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Gibson</i> is for <i>Jesus</i> of <i>Nazareth</i>'s
Messiahship, because he cured the
<i>bodily Blindness</i> of many miraculously;
And a good Work it was: But I am for
the Messiahship of a spiritual <i>Jesus</i> to
come, who will open the <i>blind Eyes</i> of
our Understandings to discern Truth from
Error, which will be a most glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54_Book6" id="Page_54_Book6">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Operation, that his <i>Jesus</i> of <i>Nazareth</i>
has not as yet done.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Gibson</i> is for <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship,
who once cured <i>bodily Deafness</i> in many,
which was indeed well done of him: But
I am for the Messiahship of a spiritual <i>Jesus</i>
to come, to heal the <i>Deafness</i> of our
Souls, or their <i>Dulness</i> in Apprehension of
sublime Mysteries, which will be a divine
Work, that his <i>Jesus</i> has not as yet
done.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Gibson</i> is for <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship,
because he cured Men's bodily <i>Lameness</i>,
for which I do praise him: But I am for
a spiritual <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship, who will
heal Mankind of their <i>Halting</i> between
two and more Opinions; a more blessed
Work, that <i>Jesus</i> of <i>Nazareth</i> has not as
yet done for us!</p>

<p>And so, comparing all other Diseases of
Body and Soul together, I am for the
<i>Jesus</i>, who will heal the Diseases of the
Soul; and have a much less Regard for
<i>Bishop Gibson's Jesus</i>, who cured the Diseases
of a few Men's Bodies; but for all
that, am not angry with the <i>Bishop</i> for
his high Veneration of his <i>Jesus</i>, neither
would I by any Means have him prosecuted
and punish'd for not being of the
same Mind with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55_Book6" id="Page_55_Book6">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>But, because the <i>Bishop</i> suspects me of
Infidelity, in that I have ludicrously treated
some of the Miracles of his <i>Jesus</i>,
which by the by he has not vindicated
from the Absurdities and Incredibilities I
charged them with; I will humour the
<i>Bishop</i>, and supposing <i>Jesus</i> wrought literally
those Miracles which are allegorically
interpreted by me, will in those very
Miracles compare his <i>literal</i> and my
<i>spiritual</i> Jesus together; and appeal to all
Men of Consideration, which is the most
worthy of the Title and Honour of the
true <i>Messiah</i>.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Gibson</i> is for his <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship,
who miraculously drove the <i>Buyers</i>
and <i>Sellers</i> out of the Temple, just as if
a Man, was God to invest him with
Power, should furiously drive the <i>Butchers</i>
and <i>Grasiers</i> with their Cattle, to the
Confusion of their several Properties, out
of <i>Smithfield</i>: A notable Miracle That!
But I am for the spiritual <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship,
who according to the Form of that
typical Story, will at his Coming expel
Ecclesiastical Merchants out of his Church,
who make Merchandise of the Gospel,
selling their <i>Bulls</i> and <i>Beasts</i>, and <i>Fatlings</i>
of the Letter: A most glorious and
beneficial Work to Mankind will this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56_Book6" id="Page_56_Book6">[Pg 56]</a></span>
be! And to prepare Mens Souls for the
Susception of such a spiritual <i>Jesus</i>, I intend
to publish a <i>Discourse</i> of the Mischiefs
and Inconveniencies of an <i>Hireling
Priesthood</i>, wherein it shall be proved,
that Mankind can't be either good, wise
or happy under the Kingdom of this <i>Messiah</i>
to come, without an Abolition and
Extirpation of them.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Gibson</i> is for the Messiahship of
his <i>Jesus</i>, who <i>cast the Devils out of the
Madmen, and permitted them to enter into
the Herd of Swine</i>, that <i>ran violently down
a Precipice, and were choak'd in the Sea</i>:
How great a Miracle it was thus to cure
the Madmen, the <i>Bishop</i> may know best,
being perhaps better acquainted with the
Devil than I am; but was it not for
Pity to the <i>Swineherds</i>, for their Losses,
I could even now laugh at the Thoughts
of the Hoggs running and tumbling
down-hill, as if the <i>Devil</i> drove them:
But leaving the Bishop <i>calmly</i>, <i>decently</i>,
and <i>seriously</i> to admire the Wisdom and
Justice of his <i>Jesus</i> in that Act, I am
for the spiritual <i>Jesus</i>, who, according
to the typical Form of that Story, exorcis'd
the furious and diabolical Tempers
out of the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i> of old,
whom no Chains of Reason could hold
from doing Violence to the Christians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57_Book6" id="Page_57_Book6">[Pg 57]</a></span>
till they were converted; and tho' He permitted
the like persecuting and diabolical
Spirits to enter into Ecclesiastical Swine;
yet will they be precipitated into the <i>Sea</i>
of the Knowledge of God, wherein they
will be absorpt with divine Visions and
Contemplations. O most glorious Work!
that bespeaks the Wisdom, Power and
Goodness of our spiritual <i>Jesus</i>, from the
Beginning to the End of it.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Gibson</i> admires his <i>Jesus</i>, for
his Transfiguration on Mount <i>Tabor</i>, tho'
neither He nor any Body else can tell,
wherein lay the Miracle, nor into what
various Figures and Shapes <i>Jesus</i> was
transform'd: But I am for the spiritual
<i>Jesus</i>, whose glorious Transfiguration, after
<i>six</i> grand Days of the Creation, will
be conspicuous, when with the Eyes of
our Understanding we shall behold him
metamorphosed into the Forms of all the
Types of him under the Law. I am now
ravish'd with the intellectual View of
this Transfiguration; and believe, was I
to set about it, I could give others (except
the Bishop) an Idea and Conception or
it to their Astonishment at the Glory of
<i>Jesus</i> in it.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Gibson</i> is for the Messiahship of
<i>Jesus</i> of <i>Nazareth</i>, because he cured a
<i>Woman of an Issue of Blood</i>, after she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58_Book6" id="Page_58_Book6">[Pg 58]</a></span>
spent all she had upon Physicians to no
purpose, which might be, or might not
be a Miracle, for any thing he can argue
upon it: But I am for the spiritual <i>Jesus</i>'s
Messiahship, who, at his Coming,
will, according to that typical Story, cure
the <i>Woman</i> of the Church of her <i>Issue of
Blood</i>, that is shed in Persecution and
War, which her Ecclesiastical Physicians
of the <i>Clergy</i> have not been able to stop,
tho' they have receiv'd large Fees and
Stipends of the Church to that Purpose.
Will not this be a desirable and beneficial
Work to all Nations? And who
knows not, (excepting the <i>Bishop</i>) that it
is of the Office of the true Messiah, to
give <i>abundance of Peace</i> to Mankind, to
<i>make the Lion to lye down with the Lamb</i>;
and to induce Men to <i>break their Swords
into Plough-shares</i>, and <i>their Spears into
Pruning-hooks</i>; and to <i>make Wars to cease</i>
in all the World. Which Prophecies are
so far from being fulfill'd by <i>Jesus</i> of <i>Nazareth</i>,
that there has been nothing but
Wrangling and Jangling, and Scolding and
Fighting about him ever since. I wonder
the Want of the Accomplishment of the
foresaid Prophecies has not long before
now occasion'd the Rejection of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Messiahship, or of the Authority of the
Prophets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59_Book6" id="Page_59_Book6">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Bishop <i>Gibson</i> is for his <i>Jesus</i>'s being
the Messiah, because he cured an old
<i>Woman</i> of a <i>Spirit</i> of, no body knows
what, <i>Infirmity</i>; consequently little or
nothing is to be laid for the Greatness of
that Miracle. But I am for the spiritual
<i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship, who, according to
the Figure of that literal Story, is to heal
the <i>Woman</i> of the Church of her <i>Infirmity
of the Spirit</i> of Prophecy, which <i>Jesus</i> of
<i>Nazareth</i> has not done for her, or there
would not be so many Disputes about
Prophecies and their Interpretations, so
far, as there is hardly one Prophecy that
Christians are agreed about the Sense of.
It is the grand Characteristick of the true
<i>Messiah</i>, that he's to restore Prophecy and
the Way of Interpretation of the Prophets,
upon the allegorical Scheme too. I speak
this, not only upon the Authority of the
Prophets themselves, but upon an almost
infinite Number of Testimonies of ancient
<i>Jews</i> and <i>Fathers</i>; accordingly I expect
the Advent of a spiritual Messiah, who
alone can do it, to heal the Church of
her present <i>Infirmity</i>, and to restore the
Art and Gift of Prophecy.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Gibson</i> is an Admirer of <i>Jesus</i>
of <i>Nazareth</i>, because he told a poor
Whore of <i>Samaria</i>, her Fortune of <i>having
had five Husbands</i>, and being then an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60_Book6" id="Page_60_Book6">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Adulteress with another Man; which, according
to the Letter, is such a poor sort
of a Miracle, that I can hardly think of
it without blushing: But I am an Adorer
beforehand of the spiritual <i>Jesus</i> who,
according to that Type, will out of the
Law and the Prophets, allegorically interpreted,
tell the present heretical and adulterous
Woman of the Church <i>all that she
has done</i>, and how she has been wedded
to the sensible Things of the <i>five</i> Books
of <i>Moses</i>, and is now an Adulteress with
the <i>Anti-Christ</i> of the Letter. Such an
Information of the Church will be a most
stupendous and miraculous Work, and a
Demonstration of our <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship
beyond Contradiction, in as much as it
will be agreeable to the Opinion, that all
Antiquity entertain'd of the true <i>Messiah</i>,
<i>viz.</i> that he was to let us into the Sight,
Knowledge and Understanding of the
Wisdom and Beauty of Providence thro'
all Ages of the World.</p>

<p>Bishop <i>Gibson</i> admires <i>Jesus</i> of <i>Nazareth</i>
for <i>his cursing the Figtree; for not
bearing Fruit out of Season</i>: Shame on
that Miracle, according to the Letter, and
on all Admirers of it! But I am for the
spiritual <i>Jesus</i>, who, at his coming to the
Figtree of his Church, will make its present
unfruitful State to <i>wither away</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61_Book6" id="Page_61_Book6">[Pg 61]</a></span>
cause it to produce the Fruits of the Spirit,
and allegorical Interpretations of the
Scriptures, that are compared to sweet and
ripe Figs. For such his Advent to this
miraculous and beneficial Purpose I daily
pray and say too, Blessed are all those who
love his Appearance!</p>

<p>After this Fashion could I go thro' the
other Miracles, I have treated on in these
<i>Discourses</i>; and upon the Comparison set
plainly before the Eyes of my <i>Readers</i> the
Difference between the <i>literal</i> Miracles of
Bishop <i>Gibson's carnal</i> Jesus and the <i>allegorical</i>
ones of my <i>spiritual</i> Jesus, as to
Stupendousness, Use and Excellency: But
what I have here done in the seven Instances
above, is enough to induce us to
believe, with the Fathers, that <i>Jesus</i>'s first
Coming in the <i>Flesh</i> was but a Type and
Shadow of his second Advent in the <i>Spirit</i>;
and that <i>Jesus</i> of old, when he appeal'd to
his Works then done, as to a Witness of his
Authority, did only prophesy, and refer
ultimately to his mystical Operations, that
are alone the Proof of his Godlike and
divine Power. Bishop <i>Gibson</i> says<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
of me, that <i>pretending to raise the Actions
and Miracles of our Saviour to a
more exalted and spiritual Meaning, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62_Book6" id="Page_62_Book6">[Pg 62]</a></span>
have labour'd to take away the Reality of
them, and by that to destroy one of the principal
Evidences of Christianity</i>. But I
presume now, he'll be sensible of the Rashness
and Incogitancy of that Accusation.
If he be not, I shall say of him, in Case
he write any more for <i>Jesus's literal</i> Miracles
in Opposition to his <i>allegorical</i> ones
that he's like the Dog in the Fable (the
Bishop will excuse the Coarseness of the
Comparison) that let go the <i>Substance</i> of
his Mutton, and catch'd at the Shadow,
and so, like a foolish <i>Cur</i> as he was, lost
both.</p>

<p>And thus have I done with the <i>Three</i>
general Heads at first proposed to be
handled in these <i>Discourses</i>. Now whether
I am, upon the whole, an <i>Infidel</i>, or
<i>Believer</i> of Christianity, the World is to
judge. I'll make no more solemn Declarations
of my Belief of it, much less at
this Juncture of Time, when I am under
Prosecution for Infidelity; because it
would be a sneaking, tame, and cowardly
Act in me, and such an Argument of
that Meanness of Spirit, as I abhor and
detest. My <i>Works</i> shall speak for me, in
which, being conscious of the Innocency
of my Intentions, and of the Usefulness
of my Design, I mean to proceed; not
doubting but some of our <i>clergy</i>, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63_Book6" id="Page_63_Book6">[Pg 63]</a></span>
two or three more <i>Discourses</i> against the
Letter of the <i>New Testament</i>, will find
me out, what I am, and whether I am
not a true Professor of the Religion of
the spiritual and holy <i>Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>In the mean Time I'll not compound
the Difference depending between Bishop
<i>Gibson</i> and my self, upon any other Terms,
than his making me ample Satisfaction
for the Injuries done to my Reputation
and low Fortunes. Tho' he may thirst
after my Life, or at least, my Liberty;
yet under the Providence of God I fear
not the Loss of either. God be prais'd,
this Kingdom is bless'd with such a
Civil Administration for Wisdom, Justice
and Mercy, as no Nation of the World
can equal. Our Magistrates are all Philosophers,
Lovers of Truth, and of an
Enquiry into it; and so tender of the
religious as well as of the civil Rights of
the Subject, that I have nothing to dread
from them.</p>

<p>There is somewhat <i>popular</i> indeed, tho'
nothing true nor rational, in the Clamour
and Accusations of the <i>Clergy</i> against me.
Bishop <i>Gibson</i> would insinuate<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> that
my <i>Discourses</i> on <i>Miracles</i> strike <i>at the
Foundation of civil Society</i>; but by an unnatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64_Book6" id="Page_64_Book6">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Consequence of his own making.
I confess, it is an heinous Crime to write
any Thing that tends to the Subversion or
Prejudice of the civil Society: But how
will the <i>Bishop</i> make me guilty of it? If
the <i>Clergy</i> will not be Disturbers of the
Peace of the Publick upon my <i>Discourses</i>;
it's certain, that the Quiet of the World,
which I wish and aim at, will be inviolably
kept and preserv'd for all me. My Followers
indeed, when I walk the Streets of
this City, are <i>numerous</i>; and if any of them
should break the Peace, what serves my
<i>Lord Mayor</i>'s Power for, but to chastise
them for it? As for my self and my Adherents
at home, which, as yet, are <i>without
Number</i>, we are all <i>Quietists</i> and should
act against our Consciences and Religion,
if we should injure any Man in his Person
and Property. But I smile to see a <i>Clergyman</i>
all on a sudden, like the <i>Bishop</i>, so
tender of the Welfare of the Publick, when
<i>Ecclesiasticks</i>, in all Ages past, have been
the <i>Bane</i> of Society and the <i>Pest</i> of Mankind,
as appears from the Wars and Persecution
they have rais'd in the World; and
from that Strife, Variance and Discords,
they have occasion'd in Cities and Families.
And with Submission to the <i>Bishop</i>, who
I hope will not be angry for my saying
it, I am sure, the <i>Clergy</i> at this Juncture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65_Book6" id="Page_65_Book6">[Pg 65]</a></span>
are like an <i>high-mettal'd blind Horse</i>, that
were they not ridden by the Civil Authority
with a strait Rein, would be oppressing
and trampling upon all, that flood in the
Way of their Interests, to the Disturbance
of <i>Civil Society</i>.</p>

<p><i>Profaneness</i> too does the <i>Bishop</i> charge
me with. But why so? Because I ridicule
the Nonsense and Absurdities of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Miracles according to the Letter, which
he venerates. Very fine indeed! The
<i>Bishop</i> would worship the <i>Head</i> of an <i>Ass</i>,
and a wiser Man than himself, without
the Charge of Profaneness, must not
laugh at his foolish Superstition.</p>

<p>And <i>Blasphemy</i> lastly does the <i>Bishop</i>
accuse me of: And this is a sad <i>Bugbear</i>
Word, that has frighted Abundance of
People into dreadful Apprehensions of my
Guilt, even to the Abhorrence of me.
But the <i>Bishop</i> should first have defined,
what is meant by <i>Blasphemy</i>, and have proved
me guilty of it, before he had made his
Exclamations: Or the <i>Turks</i> may say that
a Jest upon their <i>Alcoran</i>, in which there
are no Contradictions, is as much a <i>Blasphemy</i>,
as any Ludicrousness upon the
<i>Gospels</i>, which are full of Inconsistencies.
That there is such a Sin or Error, call'd
<i>Blasphemy</i>, according to the Scriptures, is
certain: But our <i>Divines</i> are undetermined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66_Book6" id="Page_66_Book6">[Pg 66]</a></span>
about the Nature of it. I intend to take
my Opportunity to treat on the Sin of
Blasphemy, and to prove, <i>Ministers</i> of
the <i>Letter</i> are the only Persons that can
be guilty of it. <i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Letter</i>,
upon the Authority of the Fathers, are
the Worshippers of the <i>Apocalyptical Beast</i>;
and anti-allegorical Expositions are that
<i>Blasphemy</i>, St. <i>John</i> writes of, which the
<i>Beast</i> and his Worshippers will open their
Mouths in, against the most High. This
shall be proved as clear as the Light.
But when I do it, I would not have any
think, it is with an Intention to bring
the Bishops of <i>London</i>, <i>Litchfield</i>, and
St. <i>David</i>'s, or any other <i>Divines</i>, under
Prosecution for that heinous Sin: No, my
God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent;
and knows how and when to
reckon with such Blasphemers, without
calling upon the Civil Magistrate to do it
for him. Should I importune the Civil
Authority to execute Vengeance upon
them, I should make a foolish <i>Calf</i> or a
Senseless <i>Idol</i> of my God, that was unable,
or knew not how, nor when to vindicate
his own Cause. Surely the <i>Bishop</i>
of <i>London</i>, upon his Prosecution of me
for <i>Blasphemy</i>, must think his God now
<i>asleep</i> or <i>gone a Journey</i> from Home; or
he would not be for taking God's own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67_Book6" id="Page_67_Book6">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Work out of his Hands, and committing
it to the Care of the Civil Magistrates.</p>

<p>The <i>Bishop</i> moreover should consider,
that the Words <i>prophane</i> and <i>blasphemous</i>
are of no Use and Signification among
Philosophers, who in Disputation never
cast them at each other, however they
may differ in Opinion. Philosophers are
all supposed to be such profound Venerators
of the Deity, as they would not
be guilty of <i>Prophaneness</i> and <i>Blasphemy</i>
for the whole World. If any of our
School of <i>Free-Thinkers</i> should say of his
Opponent that he's <i>prophane</i> and <i>blasphemous</i>,
he would be reprimanded for want
of Wit, Temper and good Manners; and
be told that he's like a <i>Billingsgate Scold</i>,
who has Recourse to impertinent bad Language,
when her Reason fails her for better
Rhetorick.</p>

<p>But it may be, for ought I know, the
<i>Bishop</i> has some Design in his Accusations
against me for <i>Profaneness</i> and <i>Blasphemy</i>;
but I hope it is a better than to
prejudice the Civil Magistrate, or to incense
the Populace.</p>

<p>According to the Fathers I am so far
from being a Blasphemer, that they say,
<i>Christ</i> upon the literal Interpretation of
his Miracles is metamorphosed into the
False-Christ, call'd <i>Anti-Christ</i>. Whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68_Book6" id="Page_68_Book6">[Pg 68]</a></span>
there is any Truth in this their Opinion I
can't be positive, till the Experiment is
fully made. But if our <i>Clergy</i> will keep
their Temper, and grant me a clear Stage
of Battle, I'll try it out; and see whether
I can't, by the Club of Reason and primitive
Authority, give their <i>Anti-Christ</i> a
fatal Blow: Who knows but I may give
Peace to the Church, and reconcile all
Parties by it?</p>

<p>However this may be; I am sure, no
Man can wish for a greater Advantage
over his Enemy, than I have over the
<i>Bishop</i> in this Controversy: But he shall
find me a generous Adversary, who will
make no worse Use of my Advantage
over him than now and then to put him
in Mind of his <i>Pastoral Letter</i>, and of the
Prosecution; unless I should be tempted,
ere long, to publish my <i>Moderatorial</i>
Letter, like his <i>Pastoral</i> one, to the People
of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i>, with <i>Ten</i>
wholesome Rules in it, not only to caution
them against false Prophets and false
Teachers, without forgetting the <i>Bishop</i>
of the <i>Diocese</i>, but to direct them to the
Ecclesiastical Fountain of the growing
Sins, Errors and Infidelity of the Age,
which the <i>Clergy</i> know I am of Ability
to lay open.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69_Book6" id="Page_69_Book6">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>When I began the Publication of these
<i>Discourses</i>, I own, I laid a <i>Trap</i> for some
considerable <i>Clergyman</i>; but little imagined,
the great <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i> would
be caught in it. But now I have taken
hold of him, I'll not release him out of the
Controversy, till he has sorely repented of
his Ignorance or Malice in calling me a
<i>Writer, in Favour of Infidelity</i>.</p>

<p>So much at present for the Bishop of
<i>London</i>. I have been the quicker of late
in the printing of <i>this</i>, because I am given
to understand, the <i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David</i>'s
stays for it, intending to make but one
Work of it, and answer all <i>six Discourses</i>
together. I hope my <i>Rabbi</i>'s Letter here
will be thought by him, a good Payment
for his Patience. And now I shall be in
Expectation of his Mountainous Production,
and where I shall hide myself from
the terrible Strokes of his Pen, I have
not as yet consider'd.</p>

<p>I am not a little pleas'd to see a <i>Couple</i>
of Dissenting Preachers, <i>viz.</i> Dr. <i>Harris</i>
and Mr. <i>Atkinson</i>, lifted into the Controversy
against me. If they had kept their
Necks out of the Collar, they might have
dissembled and pretended, that, upon the
Conclusion of the Battle, when it would
have appear'd, I am a real Contender for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70_Book6" id="Page_70_Book6">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Primitive Christianity, they had a better
Understanding of the Fathers, and a clearer
View of my Design, than to suspect me
of Blasphemy and Infidelity: But now
they are engag'd with equal Spite, Ignorance
and Defamations against me, they
must take their Share of the Fate and
Shame, with the <i>Clergy</i>, upon the Conclusion
of the Controversy.</p>

<p>There's no Body can think it worth my
while to bestow a Six-penny <i>Pamphlet</i> upon
either of these <i>Gentlemen</i>, but for all that,
they shall not be altogether slighted and
neglected by me. I have made a Collection
of their Rhetorical Flowers, which
occasionally shall be presented the Publick,
to the Admiration of their Wit,
Reason, Learning and Eloquence. And
at present only take Notice, that they
are <i>both</i> for the Persecution of me; but
not so much for my Opinions, as the Indecency,
Irreverence, and Immorality of
my Stile; forsooth! which is just such a
Distinction, as may be easily stretch'd to
the Justification of the Persecution of all
Authors, whom the Priesthood in Power
shall not like. Mr. <i>Atkinson</i>'s Argument
for the Persecution of me, is much the
same with that, which <i>John Calvin</i> used
for the Persecution of that great Philosopher
<i>Servetus</i>; the Injustice and Cruelty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71_Book6" id="Page_71_Book6">[Pg 71]</a></span>
whose Death and Sufferings is a greater
Reproach to the Name of <i>Calvin</i>, than
the Martyrdom of any <i>Protestant</i> can be to
the Memory of any Popish Prelate.</p>

<p>To conclude, what I have written, in
these <i>Six Discourses</i>, is with a View to
the Glory of God, the Advancement of
Truth, the Happiness of Mankind, the
Demolition of <i>Babylon</i>, the Edification of
<i>Jerusalem</i>, and the Demonstration of the
Messiahship of our Spiritual <i>Jesus</i>, to
whom be Glory for ever. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p><i>ot long since the</i> Bishop
<i>of</i> St. David<i>'s
presented to Your</i> Majesty
<i>his</i> Vindication;
as <i>I would have
done this my</i> Defence,
<i>if I had known how to get Access
to Your Royal Presence</i>.</p>

<p><i>Your</i> Majesty <i>will perceive, that
here's a sad War broke out between
the</i> Bishop <i>and my self, about</i>
Miracles; <i>which, in all probability,
will cost a large Effusion of Words;
and, unless Your</i> Majesty <i>can accommodate
the Difference, will hardly
be terminated without the Slaughter
of many Notions and Arguments</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Bishop <i>is for making Your</i>
Majesty <i>the Arbitress of our Controversy,
which I consent to; and he
talks of Your singular Qualifications
to preside at it, which I as certainly
believe, as that a</i> Bishop <i>will not lye
nor flatter</i>.</p>

<p><i>Had I known before of Your</i> Majesty's
<i>Abilities at this Controversy,
I should have gone near to have applauded
You for them; and the World
would readily have believed my Praises
of You to be just, because I had no
Bishoprick nor</i> Translation <i>in View
for them</i>.</p>

<p><i>If Your</i> Majesty <i>has no extraordinary
Talent at this Controversy, I
trust, You are wiser than to think
the Better of Your self for the</i> Bishop<i>'s
Compliment. You'll not be vain;
tho' he is fulsome.</i></p>

<p><i>But the Bishop</i>, Madam, <i>has done

<p>t Last, one Volume of <i>Bishop
Smalbroke</i>'s mountainous
Work, that the <i>Press</i>
has been so long pregnant
with, is brought forth: And
I don't doubt, but it answers
the Expectations of the <i>Clergy</i>, who will
extol it to the Skies, and applaud it to the
Populace, as an absolute Confutation of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_Book7" id="Page_2_Book7">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<i>Discourses</i>; but I would advise them, if it
be not too late, not to be too profuse in
their Commendations of it, for fear that
an Occasion should be given them to blush
for their want of Judgment. We have
had Instances of Books before now (and
one very remarkable, in the Case of <i>Boyle</i>
against <i>Bently</i>) that have met with a general
Approbation, till they have been sifted
into, and upon Examination found
empty; and it is not impossible, but <i>this</i>
of the <i>Bishop</i> before us, may meet with the
same Fate.</p>

<p>I had conceived a great Opinion of this
<i>Bishop</i>'s Learning and Abilities, and, if he
had not sent<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> two simple <i>Harbingers</i>
before-hand, should have been so apprehensive
of his Acuteness, that nothing, but
a thorough Persuasion of the Goodness of
my Cause, and of my Power to defend it,
could have kept me from Flight before
him. But I stand my Ground, and shall,
against greater Adversaries than this <i>Bishop</i>,
who has more weakly and maliciously attack'd
me, than you'd have been expected
from one of his reputed Candour and
Learning; and given me greater Advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_Book7" id="Page_3_Book7">[Pg 3]</a></span>
to insult and triumph over him, than
I could wish or desire.</p>

<p>Many other little <i>Whifflers</i> in Divinity
have before attack'd me with their <i>Squibs</i>
and <i>Squirts</i> from the <i>Press</i>, but I despised
them all, as unworthy of my particular
Regard and Notice, reserving my self for
Defence against this <i>Bishop</i>'s grand Assault;
when, by the by, I might have an Opportunity
to animadvert on one or other
of them. Some of these <i>Whifflers</i>, like
Men of Honour, have set their Names to
their Works; others very prudently have
concealed their Names, which, upon the
best Enquiry I could make, I have not
been able to discover, or I had given them
a Rebuke for their Impudence and Slanders.
It may be wonder'd, that any polemical
Authors, especially when they
write on the orthodox and establish'd Side
of the Question, should conceal themselves,
and that they are not tempted with
the Hopes of Reward and Applause to
make themselves known. I will say what
I think here, that it's never Modesty in
such <i>anonymous</i> Authors (for we <i>Scribblers</i>
in Divinity, whatever we may pretend,
have always a good Conceit of our selves)
but Apprehensions of a sharp Reply to
their Dishonour. And this is the true Reason,
why some of my Adversaries industriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_Book7" id="Page_4_Book7">[Pg 4]</a></span>
conceal themselves, knowing that
they are guilty of wilful and malicious
Lies and Calumnies, which I should chastise
them for. But, as their Names are
supprest, they know, it's to no Purpose
for me to expose their Malice, because no
body can be put to shame for it.</p>

<p>The <i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David's</i> acts here a
more glorious Part: He comes not behind
me, like other <i>Cowards</i>, to give me a secret
Knock on the Pate, but like a courageous
Champion, looks me in the Face,
and admonishes me to stand upon my
Guard. This is bravely done in him! And
I have no Fault to find, but that he is providing
himself with <i>Seconds</i> in the Controversy,
I mean the <i>Civil Powers</i>, and calling
upon them to destroy me, before the
Battle is well begun, and whether he gets
the better of me or not. This is not fairly
nor honourably done of the <i>Bishop</i>, and
I have Reason to complain of it. Tho' I
think my self equal, if not superior in the
Dispute, to any of our <i>Bishops</i>, yet I am
not a Match for the <i>King</i>'s Power, neither
would I lift up my Hand, or use my Pen
against him for all the World. If the <i>Bishop</i>
will yield to a fair Combat, and desire
the Civil Authority to stand by and see
fair Play between us, I will engage with
him upon any Terms. But to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5_Book7" id="Page_5_Book7">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<i>Civil Powers</i> Parties in our Quarrel, and
to bespeak them, right or wrong, to favour
his Side, is intolerable, and what we
spiritual Gladiators ought to abhor and detest.</p>

<p>I liked the <i>Bishop</i>, when he proposed to
the <i>Queen</i> to be <i>Arbitress</i> of our Controversy.
As I will not here question her
Qualifications to judge in it, so the first
Opportunity I have of waiting on her <i>Majesty</i>,
I will join my Requests to her to accept
of the Trouble and Office. After she
has fix'd the Terms of Disputation, and
thought of a proper Reward for the <i>Victor</i>,
or a Punishment for the <i>Conquer'd</i>, then
will we proceed, and either dispute the
Matter from the Press, or scold it out in
the Queen's Presence, as she shall think it
most conducive to the Edification of herself,
and of her Court-Ladies.</p>

<p>But the <i>Bishop</i>'s Proposal here, and Compliment
on the <i>Queen</i>, is but the Copy of
his Countenance. He'll submit to no Arbitration:
No, no, he's for having the Civil
Powers to be immediate Executioners
(without further hearing what I have to
say for my self) of his Wrath and Vengeance
upon me. He's for having them to
take it for granted, that he has proved me
an <i>Infidel</i> and <i>Blasphemer</i>, and would have
them to inflict some exemplary Punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6_Book7" id="Page_6_Book7">[Pg 6]</a></span>
upon me, so as to incapacitate me for
ever writing more. Wherefore else does
he say thus?<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> "Indeed a more proper
Occasion cannot possibly happen in a
Nation, where Christianity is establish'd
by human <i>Laws</i>, to invigorate the Zeal
of the Magistrate, in putting the Laws
in Execution against so flagrant a Sort
of Profaneness, that tramples with such
Indignity on the Grounds of the <i>Christian</i>
Faith; and to convince the World
that the <i>Minister</i> of that <i>God</i>, who is so
highly affronted, <i>bears not the Sword in
vain</i>. And certainly the Higher Powers
have great Reason to exert their Authority
on this and the like Occasions."</p>

<p>I was astonish'd at this Passage, with
some others, in the <i>Bishop</i>'s <i>Dedication</i>, and
could hardly believe my Eyes when I read
it; that a Scholar, a Christian, and a Protestant
Bishop, should breath so much
Fury and Fire for the kindling again of
<i>Smithfield</i> Faggots! That any Thing of
human Shape should so thirst after that
Destruction of another, which would turn
to the Ruin of his own Reputation and
Honour! Does the <i>Bishop</i> believe that he
has clearly confuted me, or does he not?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7_Book7" id="Page_7_Book7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
If he believes, and others know that I am
absolutely confuted, then there's an End
of the Controversy, the Danger of my
<i>blasphemous</i> Books is over; and why should
I undergo any Punishment, which would
move the Compassion of many, and give a
greater Reputation to my Writings than
they do deserve? Does the <i>Bishop</i> think he
has confuted me? This is Honour and
Triumph enough to him; who, of all
Men, should not desire me to be otherwise
punish'd, for fear of getting the Character
of a merciless and implacable Conqueror.
Am I in my own Opinion confuted
and baffled? This would be Pain
and Mortification enough, even worse than
Death. For, however we polemical <i>Writers</i>
may pretend a Readiness to part with
our Errors upon Conviction, as if we
could easily yield to our Adversaries, yet
it goes to the Hearts of us to be out-done
in Reason and Argument. As it is said
of <i>Bishop Stillingfleet</i>, that, being sensible
of his Insufficiency to contend with Mr.
<i>Lock</i>, he grieved and pined away upon it:
So I, upon Supposition the Bishop of St.
<i>David's</i> has confuted me, must not only
necessarily afflict my self, but undergo the
Shame of the Reproaches of the People,
for my wicked and impotent Efforts to
subvert their Religion: And what would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8_Book7" id="Page_8_Book7">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the <i>Bishop</i> have more? He could desire no
more, if he had absolutely confuted me:
But it's plain he dares not trust to his own
Confutation of me; it's plain he's afraid
of, what he is conscious may be made, a
smart Reply to him, and therefore he calls
upon the Civil Magistrate for his Help to
prevent it.</p>

<p>After that the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i> had
publish'd his <i>Pastoral Letter</i>, and it was
reported that the <i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David's</i> was
preparing a strenuous Vindication of the
<i>litteral</i> Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, I concluded
that the Prosecution would immediately
be dropp'd, and that the Clergy
were betaking themselves to that Christian,
Rational, and Philosophical Course of Confutation,
and would no longer make use
of Persecution, which is the Armour of
hot, furious, and ignorant Bigots. And
there is one Passage in the <i>Bishop</i>'s <i>Pastoral
Letter</i>, which I interpreted as a Grant
of full Liberty; but, whether I am apt
to mistake the Sense of the Fathers of the
<i>Primitive</i> Church or not, I find I did misconstrue
the Words of a Father of our
<i>English</i> Church, and turn'd them to another
and better Purpose than he aim'd at.
His Words are these<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> "And as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9_Book7" id="Page_9_Book7">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<i>blasphemous manner</i>, in which a late
Writer has taken the Liberty to treat
our Saviour's Miracles, and the Author
of them; tho' I am far from contending,
that the Grounds of the Christian
Religion, and the Doctrines of it, may
not be discuss'd at all Times in a calm,
decent, and serious Way (on the contrary,
I am sure that the more fully
they are discuss'd, the more firmly they
will stand) yet I cannot but think it
the Duty of the Civil Magistrate, at
all Times, to take Care that Religion
be not treated in a <i>ludicrous</i> or <i>reproachful</i>
Manner, and effectually to discourage
such Books and Writings as strike
equally at the Foundation of all Religion,
<i>&amp;c.</i>" What the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>L.</i>
here says, of his <i>thinking it the Duty of
the Civil Magistrate at all Times, to take
Care that Religion be not treated in a ludicrous
manner</i>, I understood as an Excuse
for what he had done in stirring up the
Civil Magistrate to a Prosecution of me;
and that now, like a Philosopher, he was
for letting Truth and Religion to take its
Course, and for leaving it to a free Discussion,
whether in a <i>ludicrous</i> or in a
<i>calm</i>, <i>decent</i> or <i>serious</i> Way. But I confess,
I have mistaken the <i>Bishop</i>'s Words,
finding by Experience, that (for all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10_Book7" id="Page_10_Book7">[Pg 10]</a></span>
natural Import of his Expression, that Liberty
should be used to discuss the Grounds
of Religion in a <i>serious</i> Manner) he'll no
more suffer it, if he can help it, to be contested
in a <i>serious</i>, than in a <i>ludicrous</i>
Way; wherefore else did he move for the
Prosecution of a late <i>London Journal</i>,
which was all <i>calm</i>, <i>decent</i>, and <i>serious</i>
Argument. And the Bishop of St. <i>David's</i>
his furious <i>Dedication</i> now, confirms me
in this Opinion, that our <i>Clergy</i> (for all
their preaching up Liberty with as much
Force and Strength of Reason as any Men,
and for all their Invitations to <i>Infidels</i>, to
say and print their worst against Christianity)
will by no means, if they can hinder
it, suffer any Attacks to be made upon
their Religion, nor cease their Importunities
and Solicitations of the Civil Magistrate
to Persecution. Blessed be God, the
<i>Bishops</i> are not my <i>Judges</i> as well as my
<i>Accusers</i>, or I know, what would become
of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Atkinson</i>, a little Writer against me,
says,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> "That I call the pretended Divines
of the Church my Prosecutors,
when they were not my Prosecutors.
And <i>again</i>, That there was no need of
my Supposition, that the <i>Clergy</i> would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11_Book7" id="Page_11_Book7">[Pg 11]</a></span>
have more Wit than to prosecute me
again for this <i>Discourse</i>; for he did not
know that they had been concern'd in
any Prosecution of me." And again he
says, "If the Civil Magistrate thinks it
his Duty to chastise me for my Sin and
Folly, I am to blame my self, and not
the <i>Clergy</i>, till I can prove the Zeal of
our Christian Government to be excited
by the malign Influence of the
<i>Clergy</i>." Mr. <i>Atkinson</i> is thus far certainly
in the right on't, that, strictly speaking,
the <i>Clergy</i> are not my Prosecutors,
but the King, who, in all probability,
knows no more of my Books than the
Man in the Moon. But whether Mr. <i>Atkinson</i>
could be so ignorant, as not to
know the <i>Clergy</i> were the grand Instigators
to Prosecution, let others judge. If he
really was such a poor <i>Ignoramus</i>, I have
no more to say: Otherwise, his Expressions
above, will be look'd upon as the vilest
Piece of Hypocrisy and Prevarication that
can be, purposely utter'd to take off the
<i>Odium</i> of the Prosecution from the <i>Clergy</i>,
and to cast it upon the Civil Government;
which, whether Mr. <i>Atkinson</i> believes it
or not, had never, but for the Solicitations
of the <i>Bishops</i>, given me any Trouble.
Mr. <i>Atkinson</i> above, acts the Part of
the Popish Clergy of <i>France</i>, upon the Revocation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12_Book7" id="Page_12_Book7">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of the Edict of <i>Nantes</i>. After
that the King, upon the urgent Importunities
of the Clergy, had resolv'd to revoke
that Edict; the Clergy were for excusing
themselves to the Protestants, and
laying the Blame only on the King, saying,
<i>The King was bent and resolv'd on't,
and they could not help it</i>; which was
such Jesuitical Prevarication in the Popish
Clergy, that the Protestants could
not forbear <i>roguing</i> them for it. Mr.
<i>Atkinson</i> knows how to apply this Story;
which I had not told, but for the Use of
the Bishop of <i>L.</i> who, upon a certain Occasion
could say, that it was not He, but
the <i>Government</i> that prosecuted Mr. <i>Woolston</i>.
If Mr. <i>Atkinson</i> was really so ignorant
as he seems to be, I suppose he is
now of another Mind, upon reading the
<i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David's</i> Dedication; and convinced
that the Prosecution against me
was began and carried on at the <i>malign
influence</i>, as he calls it, of the Clergy.</p>

<p>I will here use no Arguments for Liberty
of Debate, which Subject has already
been copiously handled, and wants
nothing, that I can add unto it. But before
I enter into the Body of the <i>Bishop</i>'s
Book, and upon a profess'd Defence of my
Discourses against him, let us consider the
manifest Lies, Prevarications, and wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13_Book7" id="Page_13_Book7">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Insinuations in his <i>Dedication</i>, whereby
he would move the Secular Powers to a
severe Punishment of me. I will pass by
the <i>Motto</i> of his Book, <i>viz. But Jesus
said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the
Son of Man with a Kiss</i>; Whereby he
would signify and intimate, not to <i>Scholars</i>
(for they have more Wit than to
think the worse of me for his Abuse of
Scripture) but to the ignorant Multitude,
that I am another <i>Judas</i>, a Traitor and Rebel
to <i>Jesus</i>. Commonly <i>Mottos</i> of Books
are suited to their Authors, and the Design
of them; whether the <i>Bishop</i> will
be willing to take this <i>Motto</i> to himself
or not, I will upon another Occasion give
it a pleasant and pertinent Turn upon
him. At present I shall only say, what
the Learned will observe, that <i>this</i> is of a
wicked and malicious Use and Intention,
of no less, than to create in the Minds of
the People an Hatred and Detestation of
me; of no other, than by dressing me up,
as it were, in a Bear's Skin, to excite the
Ecclesiastical and merciless Mob to worry
and destroy me. Such has been the roguish
Artifice of priests of all Ages, to represent
their Adversaries, whom they
would destroy, under odious and borrow'd
Names, that their Persecutions of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14_Book7" id="Page_14_Book7">[Pg 14]</a></span>
might be thought the less cruel. But passing
this by for the present, the</p>

<p>I. First wicked and wilful Misrepresentation
that the <i>Bishop</i>, in his Dedication,
has made of me, is that of being an
<i>Infidel</i>, and an <i>Apostate</i> Clergyman. Wherefore
else does he say thus to the Queen:
"What is now presented to your Royal
View, is an Apologetical Defence of our
holy Religion, against one of the most
virulent Libels on it, by an <i>Apostate
Clergyman</i>, that has appear'd in any
Christian Country; and in Comparison
of which, other <i>Infidels</i> have acted a
modest Part." And again he calls my
<i>Discourses</i>, "A flagrant Sort of Profaneness,
that tramples with Indignity on
the Grounds of the Christian Faith."
And again he signifies, "That I am warmly
engaged in subverting the Christian
Religion, and active in propagating Infidelity."
This is all wilful and downright
Calumny, to incense the Queen and
the Government against me. The <i>Bishop</i>
knows in his Heart that I am no <i>Infidel</i>,
but a Believer of Christianity, notwithstanding
my <i>Discourses</i> on Miracles, that
have occasion'd such a Clamour against
me. In my <i>Discourses</i>, I have repeatedly
and most solemnly declared, that my Designs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15_Book7" id="Page_15_Book7">[Pg 15]</a></span>
are not to do Service to Infidelity,
but to advance the Glory of God, the
Truth of Christianity, and to demonstrate
the <i>Messiahship</i> of the holy <i>Jesus</i>. If I
have sometimes ridiculed the litteral Story
of our Saviour's Miracles, I have profess'd
as often that it was with Design to turn
Men's Hearts to the mystical Interpretation
of them, on which alone <i>Jesus</i>'s Authority
and Messiahship is founded. I could
collect a great Number of Passages out of
my <i>Discourses</i> to this Purpose, if it would
not be wasting of Time and Paper. And
do all these solemn Declarations of my
Faith, and of the Integrity of my Heart,
and of the Sincerity of my Intentions, stand
for nothing? Why should not my Word
here be taken? I can think of no other
Reason, than because some other Folks are
accustom'd to dissemble and prevaricate
with God and Man in their Oaths and
Subscriptions, therefore I may be suspected
here of Hypocrisy, notwithstanding my
Professions to the contrary.</p>

<p>Besides, the <i>Bishop</i> knows by my other
Writings, that I am certainly a Christian,
and a true Believer of the Religion of
Christ, though I may have some different
Conceptions from other Men about it. It
has been my good Luck before, not only
to publish more Treatises purposely and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16_Book7" id="Page_16_Book7">[Pg 16]</a></span>
professedly in Defence of Christianity,
than any <i>Bishop</i> in <i>England</i>; but some of
them are of such a Nature, as it's impossible
for a Man to write without being a
Christian, and impossible for him to depart
from the Principles of them. This is my
good Fortune and Happiness at this Juncture.
The <i>Bishop</i> has perused, I see, some
of my other Writings, and particularly,
my <i>Old Apology for the Truth of Christianity
revived</i>; and to his Praise, as well
as my Comfort be it spoken, he apprehends
and rightly relishes it. And as I
was well pleased with his Representation
of the Design of that Book, from the
Principles and allegorical Scheme of which,
he says (in Twenty-four Years since) I
am not departed; so I would appeal to his
Conscience, Whether a Man, who wrote,
as I did then, of the Typical and Antitupal
Deliverance of the <i>Jewish</i> and <i>Christian</i>
Church, can possibly be an Infidel,
or ever depart from the Christian Faith?
If the <i>Bishop</i> has Ingenuity equal to his
Penetration into that Book, he must own
and confess to the World, that I was then,
and am still a Christian, a Man of fix'd
and unalterable Principles from that Day
to this.</p>

<p>The <i>Bishop</i> would be thought in his
<i>Preface</i> to enumerate all my Writings;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17_Book7" id="Page_17_Book7">[Pg 17]</a></span>
but there are three others, whether wilfully
or negligently omitted by him, I
know not, that are direct Defences of the
Truth of Christianity; and there is not a
learned <i>Clergy-man</i> in <i>England</i> (I humbly
presume to say it) who can read them,
and not applaud them. If the <i>Bishop</i> will
be pleas'd to read one of them, <i>viz. The
Defence of the Miracle of the Thundering
Legion</i>, and say it from his Heart, that I
might write that Book, and believe the Ecclesiastical
Story of that Miracle, and yet
be no Christian, then I will yield to his
Accusation against me for Infidelity.</p>

<p>But why do I trouble my self thus to
assert and vindicate my Belief of Christianity?
The <i>Bishop</i> would readily come into
the Acknowledgment of my being a
sincere Christian, but for his Interests and
Prejudices, and other political Considerations,
which influence him and the <i>Clergy</i>
so to decry and defame me, that, if possible,
I must be destroy'd, or at least have
my Mouth stopp'd.</p>

<p>In short then, it is not because I am an
<i>Infidel</i>, that the <i>Clergy</i> so exclaim against
me and my <i>Discourses</i>; but because, as a
Christian, I have particular Designs in
view, which, if I can compass, will tend
to their Dishonour, and the Ruin of their
Interests; and therefore, by Defamations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18_Book7" id="Page_18_Book7">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and Prosecutions, they will, if they can,
in time put a stop to them. The Designs
that, for the Truth of Religion, and Good
of Mankind, I have in view, and which,
maugre all Opposition, Terrors, and Sufferings,
I will pursue to the utmost of my
Power, are these three.</p>

<p>1. To restore the Allegorical Interpretation
of the Old and New Testament,
that is call'd, say the Fathers, the sublime
Mountain of Vision, on which we
shall contemplate the Wisdom and Beauty
of the Providence of God; and behold
the glorious Transfiguration of <i>Jesus</i> with
<i>Moses</i> and <i>Elias</i>, that is, the Harmony
between the Gospel and the Law and the
Prophets, agreeably to <i>Jesus</i>'s typical
Transfiguration. And this is such a glorious
and beatifick Vision, that it's enough
to ravish our Hearts with the Hopes and
Desires of attaining to it. The old <i>Jews</i>
say, that the allegorical Interpretation of
the Scriptures will lead us to the sight of
God and convert even <i>Atheists</i>. The Fathers
say, that the allegorical Interpretation
will be the Conversion of the <i>Jews</i> in
the Perfection of Time; and St. <i>Augustin</i>
speaks of a great allegorical <i>Genius</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19_Book7" id="Page_19_Book7">[Pg 19]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
that will be sent to that Purpose. I believe
all this, and being convinced of the
Truth of it, I am much addicted to Allegories.
And it is plain enough, and wants
no Proof, that the Revival of the allegorical
Scheme, which I am fond of, portends
Ruin to the <i>Ministry of the Letter</i>;
and will be such an Argument of the Ignorance
and Apostacy of our <i>Clergy</i>, that
it's no wonder they defame, calumniate,
and persecute me for my Attempts towards
it.</p>

<p><i>Origen</i> says,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> that <i>litteral Interpreters
will run into Infidelity</i>, which is a
Saying I am well pleased with, and thereupon
will try if I can't turn the Tables
upon our <i>Clergy</i>; I'll try if I can't shift
from my self the present Load of Reproaches
for Infidelity, and lay it upon
them. What would the Wife and the
Learned then say? That the great <i>Bishops</i>
of <i>London</i> and St. <i>David's</i> had caught a
<i>Tartar</i>.</p>

<p>I have indeed ludicrously treated the
Letter of the Scriptures (in my <i>Discourses</i>)
which by the said <i>Bishops</i> is
falsly called <i>Blasphemy</i>: But should they
either <i>ludicrously</i> or <i>sedately</i> write against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20_Book7" id="Page_20_Book7">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the allegorical Sense of them, I could prove
<i>that</i> to be real <i>Blasphemy</i>. However, I
would not complain to the Civil Powers
against them; no, it's God's peculiar Prerogative
to punish that Sin, which ought
not to be committed to the Care of the
Civil Magistrate.</p>

<p>But what need I <i>ludicrously</i> to handle
the Letter of our Saviour's Miracles? Because
some Sort of Stories are the proper
Subjects of <i>Ridicule</i>; and because, <i>Ridiculum
acri fortius &amp; melius</i>, Ridicule will
cut the Pate of an Ecclesiastical Numbskull,
which calm and sedate Reasoning
will make no Impression on.</p>

<p>To speak then the Truth in few Words.
As I am resolv'd at any Rate to run down
the <i>Letter</i>, in order to make way for the
<i>Spirit</i> of the Scriptures, so certainly will
our Clergy, for their Interests and Honour,
as Ministers of the Letter, vilify
and reproach me, and pursue me with an
implacable Hatred: But I should think it
meet for them to use a little more Temper
in their Revilings, for fear the Torrent
of Reproaches should sometime or other
turn on them. It is asserted and predicted
by the Fathers that, after a certain Time
of the Church's Apostacy to the <i>Letter</i>,
the <i>Spirit of Life</i>, or the allegorical Sense
will re-enter the Scriptures, to the Advancement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21_Book7" id="Page_21_Book7">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of divine Knowledge and true
Religion; in the mean while the <i>Clergy</i>
will do well to see to it. But,</p>

<p>2. The Second Design which, as a Christian,
I have in View, and which occasionally
I write for, is an universal and
unbounded Toleration of Religion, without
any Restrictions or Impositions on
Men's Consciences; for which Design, the
<i>Clergy</i> will hate and defame me, and, if
possible, make an Infidel of me, as well as
for the former. Upon an universal Toleration
the World would be at quiet: That
Hatred of one another, which is now so
visible among different Sects, would then
be terminated by a Unity of their Interests,
when they are all upon the Level
in the Eye of the Civil Magistrate, who
would choose Men to Places of Trust, not
for their Faith and Affection to Theological
Doctrines, but for their Abilities to
serve the Publick. In this Case, Ten thousand
different <i>Notions</i> in Religion would
no more obstruct the Welfare of the Community,
than so many different <i>Noses</i> do
the Happiness of this City. The Variety
of their Theological Opinions, would be
the Diversion and Amusement of each
other; and so long as it was out of their
Power to oppress, they could not hate
one another for them. Such a Toleration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22_Book7" id="Page_22_Book7">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the <i>Clergy</i> would persuade us, tends
to Confusion and Distraction, as if Men
would go to <i>Loggerheads</i> upon it. But
this is one of their Mistakes; there would
be a perfect Calm upon it, if such Incendiaries
as they are did not disturb the publick
Tranquillity. They'll tell us again,
that such a Toleration makes Way for
Dissoluteness of Morals, and would let in
Sin like a Deluge upon us; but this is
another of their Errors. Such a Toleration
would promote Virtue, in as much
as different Sects of Religion are a Check
upon each other against Looseness of Morals,
because every Sect would endeavour
to approve itself above others, by the
Goodness of their Lives, as well as by
the Excellency of their Doctrine. But
the <i>Clergy</i> will never hearken to such a
Toleration, because it would be the Downfall
of Ecclesiastical Power; for which
Reason, among many others, I am</p>

<p>3. For the Abolition of an hired and
establish'd Priesthood. And for this, if for
nothing else, I am sure to be prosecuted
with Hatred and Violence, and loaded
with the Calumnies and Reproaches of Infidelity
and Blasphemy: And the <i>Clergy</i>,
if possible, will have my Mouth stopp'd,
and my Hands tied, before I proceed too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23_Book7" id="Page_23_Book7">[Pg 23]</a></span>
far in my Labours and Endeavours to this
End.</p>

<p>And why should not the <i>Clergy</i> of the
Church of <i>England</i> be turn'd to Grass,
and be made to seek their Fortune among
the People, as well as Preachers of other
Denominations? Where's the Sense and
Reason of imposing Parochial <i>Priests</i> upon
the People to take care of their Souls,
more than Parochial <i>Lawyers</i> to look to
their Estates, or Parochial <i>Physicians</i> to attend
their Bodies, or Parochial <i>Tinkers</i> to
mend their Kettles? In secular Affairs every
Man chooses the Artist and Mechanick
that he likes best; so much more ought
he in Spirituals, in as much as the Welfare
of the Soul is of greater Importance than
that of the Body or Estate. The Church-Lands
would go a good, if not a full Step,
towards the Payment of the Nation's
Debts.</p>

<p>I have promised the World, what, by
the Assistance of God, and the Leave of
the Government, shall be publish'd, a <i>Discourse</i>
on the Mischiefs and Inconveniencies
of an Hired and Establish'd Priesthood:
In which it shall be shewn,</p>

<p>I. That the Preachers of Christianity
in the first Ages of the Church (when
the Gospel was far and near spread, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24_Book7" id="Page_24_Book7">[Pg 24]</a></span>
triumph'd over all Opposition of <i>Jews</i>
and <i>Gentiles</i>) neither received nor insisted
on any Wages for their Pains, but were
against preaching for Hire; and, as if they
had been endew'd with the Spirit of Prophecy,
before an Hireling Priesthood was
establish'd, predicted their Abolition and
Ejection out of Christ's Church.</p>

<p>II. That since the Establishment of an
<i>Hire</i> for the Priesthood, the Progress of
Christianity has not only been stopt, but lost
Ground; the Avarice, Ambition, and Power
of the Clergy having been of such unspeakable
Mischief to the World, as is enough
to make a Man's Heartake to think,
read, or write of.</p>

<p>III. That upon an Abolition of our present
establish'd Priesthood, and on God's
Call of his own Ministers, the Profession of
the Gospel will again spread; and Virtue,
Religion, and Learning, will more than
ever flourish and abound.</p>

<p>The Clergy are forewarn'd of my Design
to publish such a <i>Discourse</i>; and this
is the secret Reason, whatever openly they
may pretend, of their Accusations against
me for Blasphemy and Infidelity. Their
Zeal and Industry will be never wanting
to prevent the Publication of this <i>Discourse</i>;
neither need I doubt of Persecution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25_Book7" id="Page_25_Book7">[Pg 25]</a></span>
if they can excite the Government to
it, to that End.</p>

<p>In my first Discourse on Miracles, I
happen'd to treat on that of Jesus's driving
the Buyers and Sellers out of the
Temple; which, upon the Authority of
the Fathers, I shew'd to be a Figure of
his future Ejection of Bishops, Priests, and
Deacons out of his Church, for making
Merchandise of the Gospel. The <i>Bishop</i>
has taken me and that Miracle to task;
and if ever any Man smiled at another's
Impertinence, I then heartily laugh'd
when I read him. I begg'd of the <i>Bishop</i>
before-hand<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> not to meddle with that
Miracle, because it was a hot one, and
would burn his Fingers. But for all my
Caution; he has been so Fool-hardy, as to
venture upon it; but has really touch'd
and handled it, as if it was a <i>burning Coal</i>.
He takes it up, and as soon drops it again
to blow his Fingers; then endeavours to
throw a little Water on <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> Part
of it to cool it, but all would not do. The
most fiery Part of it, <i>viz.</i> that of its being
a Type of Jesus's future Ejection of
mercenary Preachers out of the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26_Book7" id="Page_26_Book7">[Pg 26]</a></span>
he has not, I may say it, at all touch'd,
except by calling it<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> <i>my allegorical Invective
against the Maintenance of the
Clergy</i>; which is such a Piece of <i>Corinthian</i>
Effrontery in the <i>Bishop</i>, that was he
not resolv'd to lye and defame at all Rates,
for the Support of their Interests, he could
never have had the Face to have utter'd.
If the <i>Bishop</i> had proved that <i>that</i> Miracle
(which litterally was such a&mdash;&mdash;, as
I dare not now call it) neither was nor
could be a Shadow and Resemblance of Jesus's
Ejection of hired Priests out of the
Church at his second Advent, and that the
Fathers were not of this Opinion, he had
knock'd me down at once. As he has done
nothing of this, so he might have spared
his Pains in Support of the Letter of this
Story. But I shall have a great deal of
Diversion with the <i>Bishop</i>, when I come,
in a proper Place, to defend my Exposition
of that Miracle. In the mean Time,
as the Bishop has publish'd one of the Articles
of my Christian Faith, thinking to
render me odious for it; so here I will
insert another, <i>viz.</i><a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> "I believe upon
the Authority of the Fathers, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27_Book7" id="Page_27_Book7">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Spirit and Power of Jesus will <i>soon</i> enter
the Church, and expel Hireling
Priests, who make Merchandise of the
Gospel, out of her, after the manner he
is supposed to have driven the <i>Buyers</i>
and <i>Sellers</i> out of the Temple."</p>

<p>Now upon all this, whether the <i>Bishop</i>,
modestly speaking, has not been unjust,
uncharitable, and insincere, to represent
me as an <i>Infidel</i>, I appeal to all learned
and ingenuous Gentlemen. I am a Christian,
though not upon the <i>litteral</i> Scheme,
which I nauseate, yet upon the <i>allegorical</i>
one. And by the following easy and
short Argument it may be proved that I
am most certainly a Christian. I heartily
and zealously contend for the allegorical
Interpretation of the Scriptures, which the
<i>Bishop</i> allows to be true of me; consequently
I must, and do believe the Scriptures
to be of divine Inspiration, or I could
not think there were such Mysteries and
Prophecy latent under the Letter of them.
Whether then a Believer of the divine Inspiration
of the Scriptures can be an Infidel
(O most monstrous Paradox!) or
any other than a Christian, judge Readers.
Nay, if <i>Origen</i>'s and St. <i>Augustin</i>'s Testimony
on my Behalf may be admitted, I
am more truly a Christian and Disciple of
the Holy Jesus, than any <i>litteral Schemist</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28_Book7" id="Page_28_Book7">[Pg 28]</a></span>
can be. <i>Origen</i> says,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> That the Perfection
of Christianity consists in a mystical
Interpretation of the Old and New
Testament, of the Historical, as well as
other Parts of it. And St. <i>Augustin</i> says,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
That they who attain to the Understanding
of the spiritual Signification of
Jesus's Miracles, are the best Doctors in
his School. The <i>Bishop</i> understands this
Argument as well as any Man, and therefore
I charge it home upon him, as a wilful
and malicious Slander, to call and account
me an Infidel in his <i>Dedication</i>, on
purpose to incense the Government against
me at this Juncture.</p>

<p>But the <i>Bishop</i> moreover calls me, as
above, an <i>Apostate Clergyman</i>; And why
so? Because I have deserted the <i>Ministry of
the Letter</i>, and betaken my self to the
<i>Ministry of the Spirit</i> of the Scriptures.
That's like the Wit and Reasoning of his
Pate! The <i>Bishop</i> is old enough, and has
read enough to know that <i>Apostacy</i>, in the
Sense of the Fathers, is a Desertion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29_Book7" id="Page_29_Book7">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the <i>Ministry of the Spirit</i>, and a Falling
into the <i>Ministry of the Letter</i> of the Scriptures;
whereupon I make bold to retort
upon the <i>Bishop</i>, and say of him, and his
Episcopal Brethren, that they are <i>Apostate
Bishops</i>.</p>

<p>But to humour the <i>Bishop</i> in his fond
<i>Dedication</i>, I will suppose my self to be,
what I am the farthest of any Man living
from being, an <i>Infidel</i> and <i>Apostate</i>; yet</p>

<p>II. The <i>Bishop</i> is a wilful Calumniator,
or, at best, an unhappy Misrepresenter of
me, and of other Infidels, saying in his
<i>Dedication</i>, that our Design is <i>To sap the
Foundation of all Government</i>, and&mdash;&mdash;<i>That
we were pursuing such Methods, as
have a natural Tendency to introduce Confusion</i>.
If this was true of us Infidels (for
now I speak of my self as one of them)
it behoves Civil Governors to look about
them, and to punish and suppress us with
all speed; and we should be the most unreasonable
Men alive, if we complain'd of
Persecution, or call'd it hard Usage. And
the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i>, and other <i>Divines</i>
(like this <i>Bishop</i>) do commonly declaim
on the Danger of Infidelity to Civil Society,
but this is all Ecclesiastical Cant and
Jargon. I thought I had given<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30_Book7" id="Page_30_Book7">[Pg 30]</a></span>
<i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i> so much on this Head of
Complaint against Infidelity, as I could
not suppose the <i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David's</i>
would ever have repeated it. It is true,
what the <i>Bishop</i> says, that <i>Religion is the
firmest Support of Government</i>, and <i>Christianity
especially lays the greatest Obligations,
on Men's Consciences, of Obedience
to the Civil Powers</i>. I believe all this, and
that the better Christians Men are, the
more quiet, peaceable, and useful Subjects,
and the greater Friends would they
be to the Civil Authority. But does it follow
from hence, that we <i>Infidels</i>, because
we have rejected the Belief of some systematical
Divinity, as the <i>Clergy</i> are fond
of, should consequently be Enemies to the
Civil Government, and Foes to the Peace,
Order, and Welfare of Society? O fie upon
the Drawers of such Consequences!
We are, I believe, a numerous and growing
Sect in these Nations, though I am
acquainted with none, no, not so much as
with the Great Mr. <i>Grounds</i>: But I could
never perceive that any of us, in Principle,
were against Civil Government, and
the Welfare of the Community; or were
for <i>Confusion</i>, for setting the People together
by the Ears, to the Disturbance of
the publick Peace and Tranquillity. No,
no, our Interests in the World, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31_Book7" id="Page_31_Book7">[Pg 31]</a></span>
other Men's, oblige us to consult the publick
Welfare; and our Consciences, from
the Religion of Nature, bind us to Obedience
to Government; and, was it not
agreeable to our Inclination, the Necessity
of Affairs would force us to be as quiet
and obedient as are any Christians: And
I thank God, we have hitherto behaved
our selves very peaceably, clear of all Suspicion
of Treason and Rebellion to any
Prince or State. The <i>Bishop</i> hints at Experience
to the contrary, but it will puzzle
him to give an Instance. One would
think, by this common Harangue, of <i>Ecclesiasticks</i>
against us <i>Infidels</i>, that Christians,
especially the Priesthood, being, as
the <i>Bishop</i> says, both <i>under the Penalties
of human Laws, and the stronger Impressions
of a future State</i>, were of a Lamb-like
Nature, and never given to disturb
the Civil Authority: And I will own
the Christian <i>Laity</i> might be acquitted
here, but for the <i>Clergy</i>, who have been
repeatedly the <i>Pest</i> and <i>Bane</i> of human Society,
the Trumpeters of Sedition and
Rebellion, and mere Make-bates in Cities
and Families. And I dare say, that if the
Civil Powers don't curb, and keep our
<i>Priesthood</i> in awe, they will upon this
present Occasion be the Disturbers of the
publick Peace. So little Sense and Truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32_Book7" id="Page_32_Book7">[Pg 32]</a></span>
is there in the <i>Bishop</i>'s present Invective
against us Infidels! If he had not been infatuated
to a Forgetfulness of the <i>Rogueries</i>
of Priests, in all Ages, against the Civil
Powers, he could never have insinuated
such a groundless and senseless Charge
against us, to the Provocation of the Civil
Magistrate to fall on us. But</p>

<p>III. The <i>Bishop</i> calumniates us Infidels
(for against his Conscience, whether I will
or not, he will have me to be one of
them) not only for being Enemies to
Government in general, which he will
have us to advance Principles destructive
of; but insinuates and asserts that we are
disaffected to the particular and present
Government of these Kingdoms, saying,
that as "we are active in propagating Infidelity,
we do in the last Resort, not
only insult the Title of <i>Defender of the
Faith</i>, but undermine the undoubted
Right of his Majesty and his Royal Family
to the Crown of these Realms, as
it is founded on the Profession of <i>Christianity</i>,
reform'd, and now legally settled
among us; and therefore Persons
of that Character may well be consider'd,
as equally false to the Author of
our Faith, and to the present Government.&mdash;&mdash;Therefore
in a just Sense of
that Allegiance which is due to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33_Book7" id="Page_33_Book7">[Pg 33]</a></span>
King, and for the Security of your Majesties,
and the Royal Family, and thereby
of the Publick it self, as well as out
of a deep Concern for the Honour and
Preservation of our most holy Faith,
the ensuing Treatise is now offer'd, under
your Majesty's Protection, to the
View of the Publick." This is all such
foolish and manifest Slander, that I can't
but think the <i>Bishop</i> mad with Rage and
Indignation at me, when he writ it. I
dare say the <i>Queen</i>, who is firmly attach'd
to the Interests of the Christian and Protestant
Religion, did, when she read all
this, almost grieve for the <i>Bishop</i>, and pity
him for his Weakness and Ignorance. It
is a <i>Maxim</i> among all Parties, that <i>Infidels</i>
are heartily affected to the present Establishment
of the State; yea, so far a
<i>Maxim</i>, that <i>Jacobites</i> and <i>High-Church-men</i>
are apt to accuse all the well-affected
to the Government, of Infidelity. From
none of the Writings or Practice of Infidels,
much less of my self, could the <i>Bishop</i>
gather any of these his <i>childish</i> Surmises.
The Government, since the Succession
of the Illustrious House of <i>Hanover</i>,
has been twice attempted to be disturb'd,
and both times by profess'd Christians.
The Rebellion at <i>Preston</i> consisted
of <i>Papists</i> and <i>High-Church-men</i>, and tho'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34_Book7" id="Page_34_Book7">[Pg 34]</a></span>
there were but few <i>Clergy-men</i> in Arms,
yet they were join'd with the Prayers and
Wishes of many Thousands of the <i>Clergy</i>,
and even, as it was suspected, of some
<i>Oxonian Bishops</i>. Bishop <i>Atterbury</i>'s Plot
too consisted of Rebellious Christians, without
the least intermixture of us <i>Infidels</i>,
who are the more zealously affected to the
Government, because of the Danger it is
sometimes in from the <i>High-Church Clergy</i>.
Away then with the <i>Bishop</i>'s Slander,
which, for all we may be Unbelievers
of Christianity, our Civil Magistrates
will laugh at and deride him for. But,</p>

<p>IV. Another Misrepresentation, more
foolish and absurd than the former, that
the <i>Bishop</i> has made of us <i>Infidels</i>, is, that
we are making Way for Popery and Slavery:
For thus he says of us, "Nothing
is more demonstrable, than that those
Adversaries (meaning us <i>Infidels</i>) of the
Christian Religion, who are now so busily
employ'd in infusing Doubts into
some weak Minds, in giving an Indifference
and Coldness to other well-meaning
Persons, and in making others, that
are viciously inclin'd, actual Proselites
to Infidelity, are pursuing such Methods
as have a natural Tendency to introduce
Confusion, and thereby betray
us into <i>Popery</i>." And again he says of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35_Book7" id="Page_35_Book7">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Infidels, "That in Consequence of their
own Infidelity, and their wicked Diligence
in spreading that Infection, are
bringing in upon us the real Persecutions
of the Church of <i>Rome</i>; who likewise,
whilst they rail so plentifully at
the most rational Religion in the World
as Superstition, give great Advantages
towards restoring the insupportable <i>Superstitions</i>
of that Communion. These
are the Persons indeed that appear in
favour of an unbounded Liberty, but
God grant it may not terminate in an
absolute <i>Slavery</i>." <i>Risum quis tenerat?</i>
Who in his Wits could write such Stuff?
And who without Impatience can read it?
I was going about a particular Dissection
of these two Paragraphs, and to lay open
the Wit, Sense, and Oratory of the <i>Bishop</i>,
to the Contemplation of his Admirers;
but I find it unnecessary, as well as
tedious to do it: The very transcribing of
them, and exposing them to View, is enough
to render him ridiculous. If there
be no more danger of Popery, Slavery,
Superstition, Tyranny, and real Persecution
from our <i>Clergy</i>, than from us <i>Infidels</i>,
the Nation is safe. <i>Infidels</i> find too
much Inconvenience in the Power, Craft,
and Follies of a Protestant <i>Clergy</i>, to make
Way for <i>Popery</i>; which, as the <i>Bishop</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36_Book7" id="Page_36_Book7">[Pg 36]</a></span>
rightly says, is a <i>Complication</i> of Errors.
There are, what the <i>Bishop</i> should have
thought of, many Protestant Priests for
an Accommodation with the Church of
<i>Rome</i>; and, if I mistake not, upon such
easy Terms as <i>this</i>, <i>viz.</i> If she'll but part
with some of her Superstitions that are of
no Use to her; our <i>Clergy</i> will admit of
others as will be of Advantage to them.
But <i>Infidels</i> are irreconcilable Enemies to
the Church of <i>Rome</i>, and so far from Wishes
and Endeavours to restore Popery, that it
is mere Nonsense to charge them with
either direct or consequential Designs so to
enslave Mankind. But</p>

<p>V. The <i>Bishop</i> says, that we Infidels
(for I am one it seems) <i>labour industriously
to root out all Sense of Virtue and
Religion among us</i>. This is sad indeed, if
true; and very bad Men should we be,
and deserving of the worst Punishment.
But this wants Proof. How does he know
that we are for rooting out all Sense of
Virtue and Religion amongst Men? Does
it appear so by our Writings or our Practices?
Does he find in our Books any Exhortations
to Looseness and Immorality?
Nothing of this I am sure. Is he then so
well acquainted with Infidels, as to know
them to be of more depraved and debauch'd
Lives than profess'd Christians?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37_Book7" id="Page_37_Book7">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Nor this neither. I have not as yet heard
that any of my Disciples have been
hang'd, lamenting his Misfortune of reading
my <i>Discourses</i>, as what encouraged
him to Sin, and brought him to the Gallows.
No, those unhappy People, hitherto,
die in the Faith and Communion of
the Church, either of <i>England</i> or of <i>Rome</i>,
and hope to be saved through the Merits
of their Saviour, Neither do, I hear
of any Gentleman, old or young, who
has given a greater Loose to his Lusts and
Passions, since he read my Books. Such
News would trouble me.</p>

<p>But because of this Out-cry of the <i>Bishop</i>,
and of other Preachers against us,
that we labour industriously to root out
all Sense of Virtue and Religion amongst
Men, I wish (for Proof) that <i>Infidels</i>
were distinguishable from Christians, that
a Comparison might be made, and the Difference
discern'd between them, as to true
Religion and Virtue. Tho' I am one of
little Acquaintance with Infidels, yet it
is my Opinion that, on this Score, they
may vie with, and, all things consider'd,
do surpass Christians. One would think,
by the <i>Bishop</i>'s Insinuation above, that
none but <i>good</i> People were of his Christian
Faith; and that all Infidels were
profligate Sinners; but he knows better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38_Book7" id="Page_38_Book7">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and what's more, he should have been
more ingenuous than to charge <i>Infidels</i>
with <i>Labours to root out all Sense of
Virtue and Religion amongst Men</i>, if it
was but in Regard to that learned Gentleman
who is supposed to be at the Head
of Infidelity, and who, they say, is as
exemplary for all social Virtues, as any
<i>Bishop</i>; and dislikes Vice and Immorality
as much as any Saint can do.</p>

<p>Whatever be the <i>Virtue</i> and <i>Religion</i> of
<i>Infidels</i>, it is all genuine, natural, and sincere;
and consequently more Praise-worthy
than <i>that</i> of hired Priests, who may
be suspected of Hypocrisy, because of their
Interests. I heard a wild Spark say, that
he could be as grave as the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i>,
if he was but as well paid for it.
Whether he believ'd the <i>Bishop</i> would
have been as loose as himself, but for his
<i>Hire</i>, I can't tell. But this is certain that,
what can't be said of Infidels, there are
Priests who put on the Face and Form of
Godliness, and want the Life and Power
of it; who lift up their Hands and Eyes
unto God, when their Hearts are far
from him; and were not their Interests
more than their Faith, a Restraint to their
Lusts, it is commonly believ'd they would
be a Company of loose <i>Blades</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39_Book7" id="Page_39_Book7">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>What a Pother is here of the Danger
and Mischief of Infidelity to Church and
State? Do but take away the Cause of
Infidelity, and the Effect ceases. And
what is the Cause of Infidelity? Why,
what <i>Origen</i> predicted, I experience to be
true, that the <i>Ministry of the Letter</i> is the
Cause of it; and I appeal to Mr. <i>Grounds</i>,
Whether litteral Expositions on the Scripture,
and the absurd Doctrines which the
<i>Clergy</i> have built upon the <i>Letter</i>, have
not been one Cause of his calling into
Question, the Truth of Christianity, and
the divine Inspiration of the holy Scriptures?
But this is not the only Cause of
Infidelity; there are other grand ones,
which Dr. <i>Moore</i> writes of, saying thus:<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
"That Men are exceedingly tempted
to think the whole Business of Religion
is at best but a Plot to enrich the
Priests, and keep the People in awe,
from observing that they, who make
the greatest Noise about Religion, and
are the most zealous therein, do neglect
the Laws of Honesty and common Humanity;
that they easily invade other
Men's Rights; that they juggle, dissemble,
and lye for Advantage; that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40_Book7" id="Page_40_Book7">[Pg 40]</a></span>
are proud, conceited, love the Applause
of the People, are envious, fierce, and
implacable, unclean and sensual, merciless
and cruel; care not to have Kingdoms
flow in Blood, for maintaining
their Tyranny over the Consciences of
poor deluded Souls." If then there is
any Danger of any kind in Infidelity, let
the <i>Clergy</i> take the Blame and Shame of
it to themselves, and not lay that Fault,
which is their own, upon other Men.</p>

<p>But observing that Dr. <i>Moore</i> above
speaks of Priests, their <i>neglecting the Laws
of Honesty</i> and <i>common Humanity</i>, as a
Cause of Infidelity, I must here do a piece
of Justice to Infidels, who place the very
<i>Essence</i> of all Religion (as I believe the
Essence of Christianity consists) in <i>common
Honesty</i>. If they keep to their Principles,
and act agreeably, they will work such a
Reformation in the World for the better,
as the <i>Priests</i> of all Ages have not been
able to do. The <i>Clergy</i> have made such a
Noise in the World about <i>Faith</i> and <i>Doctrine</i>,
that the People hardly think they
need be <i>Honest</i> to be good Christians and
even many <i>Clergy-men</i> are conceited of
their being <i>orthodox</i> and <i>sound Divines</i>,
though by their Dishonesty, Profuseness,
and Neglect of a Provision for their Families,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41_Book7" id="Page_41_Book7">[Pg 41]</a></span>
they have, in the Judgment of<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
St. <i>Paul</i>, deny'd the Faith, and are worse
than Infidels.</p>

<p>And thus have I consider'd the Slanders
and Misrepresentations of my self and
Infidels, contain'd in the <i>Bishop</i>'s <i>Dedication</i>
to the <i>Queen</i>, which entirely is such
a Piece of Fury, Railing, and Impertinence,
as a Man shall hardly meet with.
Surely he was not awake when he wrote
his <i>Dedication</i>, it is so like the <i>Dream</i> of a
disorder'd Brain which consists of confused
Notions, and scatter'd Ideas, that are
never to be so compacted together, as to
make tolerable Sense, Reason, and Truth.
If I had not met with much such flaming
Stuff in the Body of his Book, I should have
suspected that some-body, more a Foe than
a Friend to him, had palm'd it upon him,
and over-persuaded him to print it, as
what would recommend him to her Majesty's
Favour.</p>

<p>Whether he'll merit a <i>Translation</i> to
an <i>Arch-Bishoprick</i>, for this Dedication,
with me is no Question. For all he may
take me for his Enemy, I wish him <i>translated</i>,
as certainly as the Government has
<i>transported</i> some other Folks, who are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42_Book7" id="Page_42_Book7">[Pg 42]</a></span>
more the Bane of Society. <i>Buggs</i> in a
House, and <i>Caterpillars</i> in a Garden, are
not a greater Grievance, than some sort
of Ecclesiastical <i>Vermin</i> in Christ's Church
and Vineyard.</p>

<p>That the <i>Bishop</i> himself admires his
<i>Dedication</i>, and is pleas'd with it, I don't
doubt. Like as <i>Bears</i> are fond of their
ill-favour'd <i>Cubbs</i>, so the Brats of some
Men's Brains, as well as those of their Bodies,
are pleasing to than; and however
deform'd and irrational in themselves, are
hugg'd by them as so many Wits and
Beauties. But whether many, beside the
<i>Bishop</i> himself, will like his <i>Dedication</i>, is
a great Question. I don't doubt, but there
may be some for Persecution as well as
the <i>Bishop</i>, and so far may approve of the
<i>Dedication</i>: But whether there is any
one that can think, he has not greatly injured
<i>Infidels</i>, and made a false Representation
of them, for being Enemies to our
Civil Government, and to our present Establishment,
can't surely be question'd. If
he be not look'd upon here, by all Mankind,
as a wilful and malicious Misrepresenter
of them, I shall much wonder at it.</p>

<p>But what's the <i>Dedication</i> to the Book
it self, will some here say? Tho' the <i>Bishop</i>
may have made some Slips in his <i>Dedication</i>
which betray Weakness and Ignorance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43_Book7" id="Page_43_Book7">[Pg 43]</a></span>
yet his following Performance
may be Strenuous and Nervous, and a
compleat Confutation of my <i>Discourses</i>.
I answer, that such a Dedication bodes ill
to the Book; and a Man may as well
expect to find the inside of a House beautiful
and richly adorn'd, when the Porch
and Entrance into it is mean and nasty;
as that an admirable Treatise for Wit,
Reason, and Learning, should follow upon
such a poor, simple, and insipid <i>Dedication</i>.
Commonly Authors take more
care in their <i>Dedications</i>, than in their
following Treatise; that is, they see better
to the Accuracy of their Expressions,
the Exactness of their Stile, and Beauty
of their Thoughts; and if they err at all
in them, it is only in Flattery, and excess
of Compliments on their Patrons.
Such Care too, after the best manner he
was able, has the <i>Bishop</i> taken in his <i>Dedication</i>
above; and whatever his Readers
and Admirers may think, the <i>Dedication</i>
is the best Part of the Book. The Exceptions
I have taken at the <i>Dedication</i>
are but small, in Comparison of the Faults
I shall find and expose in the <i>Book</i> it
self; which is such a Complication of Impertinence
and Errors, of Rage and Confidence,
and of Calumnies and Reproaches,
as is not to be equall'd; and is so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44_Book7" id="Page_44_Book7">[Pg 44]</a></span>
from deserving the Character of a Confutation
of my <i>Discourses</i>, that it has
done them Service; and will be, after the
Animadversions I shall make on it, a Confirmation
of the Goodness, Usefulness, and
Excellency of my Design in them.</p>

<p>I have not here room to make a compleat
Dissection of the <i>Bishop</i>'s Work, and
to display its Insufficiency, in answer to
my <i>Discourses</i>; neither was it my Design
in this <i>first Part</i> of my <i>Defence</i> to do it.
But however, I will spare a Place here for
a short Character and Representation of
his Performance, which take as follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The <i>Bishop</i>'s sole Aim and Design is
to vindicate the <i>litteral Story</i> of our Saviour's
Miracles, against my rational
and authoritative Objections to it. And
to this Purpose he wrangles with me,
where he can, about the Sense of this
and that Citation out of the Fathers;
and after he has forc'd another Sense on
it, than the Words do naturally bear,
then he insults me for a Misrepresentation.
And where he meets with a plain
Testimony out of the Fathers, which
he can't mangle nor strain to his Purpose,
he fluently passes by it; tho' he
would have his <i>Readers</i> to believe, he
has vindicated the litteral Story against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45_Book7" id="Page_45_Book7">[Pg 45]</a></span>
my Authorities, and shewn that the Fathers
were all on his Side.</p>

<p>"He complains of my Mutilations of
the Fathers, and of making too curt
Citations out of them; which is true,
but more to my own Disadvantage than
to his. But, what is Matter of grand
Triumph to the <i>Bishop</i>, is, that I have
quoted <i>spurious</i> Works of the Fathers
for <i>genuine</i> ones. And here he takes
great Pains, and wastes Time and Paper,
to prove that <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> Book
does not belong to the Author under
whose Name I cite it; and then has a
Fling at me for want of Skill in <i>Criticism</i>.
But can the <i>Bishop</i> be so weak,
as to think, I did not know when I quoted
a <i>spurious</i> Work? Supposing the
<i>Book</i> I quoted do not belong to the reputed
Author, but to some other Writer,
what's that to the Question between
us? The Citation is no less the
Testimony of Antiquity, and it's no
matter whose Name it bears. If the <i>Bishop</i>
had thought a little on this, he
might have spared some Sheets of Paper,
which he has in vain wasted, to
the Loss of his Readers Time and Money.</p>

<p>"Again, where my rational Arguments
against the <i>Letter</i> seem to the <i>Bishop</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46_Book7" id="Page_46_Book7">[Pg 46]</a></span>
be weak and inconclusive; there, to
do him Justice, he handsomly turns
upon me with his Reasoning, and admonishes
me of my Spitefulness against
the <i>Letter</i>, or I would never use such a
slight Argument. But where I pinch
and bear hard upon the <i>Letter</i>, and the
Jest is not to be digested, there, instead
of Reasoning against me, he makes a
hideous Out-cry of Buffoonery, Blasphemy,
and Infidelity; and calls upon
the Civil Magistrate for his Help, or
their Religion, and their <i>All</i> is in Danger,
through the impious Writings of
untoward Infidels.</p>

<p>"The <i>Bishop</i> in some Cases gives up
the Cause, and seems himself to be almost
ashamed of the <i>Letter</i>; and for
the Maintenance of the Honour of <i>Jesus</i>,
and the Dignity of his miraculous
Operation, flies to Allegory; allowing
that <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> Miracle might be
typical and figurative of somewhat else,
as his Thoughts did suggest to him. But
here he discovers his poor Talent at Allegories,
making no more Resemblance
between the <i>Type</i> and <i>Antitype</i>, than
between an <i>Apple</i> and an <i>Oyster</i>.</p>

<p>"I am repeatedly charg'd by the <i>Bishop</i>
with Infidelity, for writing against
the <i>Letter</i>, tho' I am as grave as a Judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47_Book7" id="Page_47_Book7">[Pg 47]</a></span>
at the allegorical Interpretation; and
he can't but know that Infidelity and
Allegorism are incompatible in the same
Person. To prove me an Infidel, he
should have shewn that I meant to pour
Contempt upon the allegorical, as well
as litteral Sense of Jesus's Miracles;
but he has not once hinted at this. A
certain great Writer, call'd Mr. <i>Grounds</i>,
plays a double Game upon the <i>Clergy</i>,
he laughs at the <i>allegorical</i> as well as
<i>litteral</i> Scheme, and distresses the <i>Clergy</i>
with his Objections against both. But
I have not done so; I really am, or
seem to be, a sincere Contender for the
allegorical Sense. And to make an <i>Infidel</i>
of an <i>Allegorist</i>, is more difficult
and impossible than to make a <i>Monkey</i>
of a <i>Bishop</i>.</p>

<p>"The <i>Bishop</i>, as a <i>Minister of the Letter</i>,
has spoken too favourably of the
allegorical Scheme; he has treated it
with too much Respect, both as to the
Origin and Use of it, and done enough
to sap the Foundation of his Church;
for which, I am afraid, he'll meet with a
Reprimand from his Episcopal Brethren.
The <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Lichfield</i> is the Man for
my Money, to write against the allegorical
Scheme; he tells us, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48_Book7" id="Page_48_Book7">[Pg 48]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
<i>St.</i> Paul <i>suffer'd in the Esteem of
the Jewish Christians for his Neglect of
Allegories; and seems to be brought into
the Use of them against his own good
liking</i>. And again,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> <i>It seems to have
been in compliance with Jewish Christians,
who were affected with allegorick
Interpretations, that St.</i> Paul <i>used that
way</i>. Which is as much as to say, St.
<i>Paul</i> was more a <i>Minister of the Spirit</i>,
than of Inclination he was disposed
to be, or, in truth, ought to have been;
and that, if he took upon him the Ministry
of the Spirit for the present, it
was only craftily and politically done
of him, to catch the <i>Jews</i> in their own
Snare of Allegories. He was consenting
that the Preachers of the Gospel,
in future Times, should desert the <i>Ministry
of the Spirit</i>, and betake themselves
to the <i>Letter</i> of the Scriptures,
as what is more agreeable to Truth,
and conducive to the Defence and Propagation
of Christianity. Such a <i>Craftsman</i>
was the inspir'd St. <i>Paul</i>, in the
Opinion of the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Lichfield</i>!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49_Book7" id="Page_49_Book7">[Pg 49]</a></span>
However, the <i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David's</i>
ought to be of the same Mind; he should
assert, that the <i>Ministry</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>
was all apostolical Craft and antient Error;
and that the present Generation
of Priests, being wiser, more learned,
and more sincere than the Primitive
and Apostolical ones, do adhere to the
<i>Ministry of the Letter</i>. Because the <i>Bishop</i>
has not gone thus far by much, he
leaves more room, than he should, for
the Revival of the <i>Ministry of the Spirit</i>;
that is, of the spiritual and allegorical
Interpretation of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>"The <i>Bishop</i> often reproves me for my
primitive Interpretation of <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>
Text of Scripture, and then palms his
own forc'd Sense on us, for natural
and genuine, contrary to the Judgment
of all Antiquity.</p>

<p>"He is so <i>grave</i>, serious, and sedate at
some simple Doctrines and Arguments,
that his <i>Readers</i> must of necessity laugh,
if not scoff at him. Was I <i>ludicrously</i>
to handle the said Doctrines, my <i>Readers</i>
would hardly smile. Such a wide
Difference is there between the <i>Levity</i>
of a Buffoon (as he is pleased to call
me) and the <i>Gravity</i> of an Ass, to the
exposing of Religion to the Ridicule and
Contempt of Mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50_Book7" id="Page_50_Book7">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lastly, He entirely mistakes the Design
of my <i>Discourses</i>; he knows not
what I aim and drive at. There's one
Paradox runs through his whole Book,
<i>viz.</i> That the litteral Story of our Saviour's
Miracles must of necessity be
true, or I should have no Foundation
to build Allegories upon; which is a
gross Mistake of other Writers against
me, as well as of himself. Who knows
not that the profest Parables of <i>Jesus</i>
have nothing of <i>Letter</i> in them, yet are
a good Foundation for Allegory? And
let me tell him here again, that whatever
was true, more or less, in the litteral
Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, there
is absolute Necessity, for the Honour
and Credit of them, to have Recourse
to the Mystery; or litterally they are,
and shall be farther proved such&mdash;&mdash;Stories,
as I dare not at present call
them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus have I given a brief Account of
the <i>Bishop</i>'s mighty and pompous Performance;
like to which he has promis'd us
another Volume, that I shall long for the
publication of, next <i>Winter</i>. This my
brief Account is but introductory to future
and larger Defences of my <i>Discourses</i>
on Miracles; which, by the Help of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51_Book7" id="Page_51_Book7">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and Permission of the Civil Authority,
shall be likewise publish'd.</p>

<p>I have not, I say, room here so much
as to defend my self on any one Miracle;
and if I had, I would not do it. For as I
can't do it without writing in the same
Stile and Strain for which I am prosecuted,
so I will do nothing that may be interpreted
as an Act in Defiance and Contempt
of the Power of the Civil Magistrate.
I did indeed publish two <i>Discourses</i>
after the Commencement of the Prosecution,
because I imagined that our <i>Bishops</i>
were more in Jest than in Earnest; or if
their Passions were raised for the present,
I thought, that after a little Consideration
of the unreasonableness of Persecution
in general, they would cool upon it, and
drop the Prosecution. But since they are
in Earnest, and I must answer to the Civil
Powers for some supposed Crimes in
my <i>Discourses</i>, I'll not repeat here the
like Acts, but be quiescent in respect to
the said Powers, to whom Reverence and
Obedience is justly due. For, tho' I look
upon the Ecclesiastical Power as an Usurpation
on the Consciences of Mankind,
yet the <i>Civil</i> is Sacred, is God's Ordinance,
and ought to be regarded as such.
But if I survive the Prosecution, and escape
with my Life and Liberty, which I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52_Book7" id="Page_52_Book7">[Pg 52]</a></span>
despair of, under so wise, just, and good
a Magistracy as this Nation is bless'd
with, the <i>Bishop</i> may expect a strenuous
Defence of my self against his weak Assaults
on me.</p>

<p>If our <i>Bishops</i> were any thing <i>Heroical</i>,
they would stop the Prosecution, and let
the Controversy take its free Course. If
they had any Sense of Honour and Reputation,
any Regard for their Learning,
they would set any Adversary of their
Church at Defiance, and disdain the Assistance
of the Civil Magistrate to punish
him, whom they could not confute. It
is the Office of the <i>Bishops</i> and <i>Priests</i> of
the Church, or I know not what is, to
convert <i>Infidels</i>, to refute <i>Hereticks</i>, and
by Reason and Argument to put to Silence
all <i>Gain-sayers</i>. Wherefore have
they a liberal and academical Education,
but to qualify them for this Work? Wherefore
do they receive large Revenues of
the Church, but to oblige and encourage
them to it? Nothing more unreasonable,
than that Men should receive Wages, when
they don't their Work. What will the
People say hereupon less, than that an
Army of at least Twenty thousand Blackguards
of the Church are hired to little or
no Purpose? The meanest of the People
may as well be taken to Church Preferments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53_Book7" id="Page_53_Book7">[Pg 53]</a></span>
as our reputed learned Divines.
They can discharge other Ecclesiastical
Offices; and when they are distress'd with
an Objection to their Religion, can do no
worse than call upon the Civil Magistrate
for his Aid and Assistance. But after all,
I am inclin'd to think our <i>Bishops</i>, in Honour,
would forbear Persecution, but for
their Interests, call'd their <i>All</i>, which depend
on the Issue of this Controversy.</p>

<p>However, not to urge the Argument for
Liberty of Debate any farther, which has
been already by others treated on to Perfection,
and will be again returned, I doubt
not, by some body else, on occasion of
this <i>Bishop</i>'s <i>Dedication</i>, I can't but take
Notice here how unpolitick, as well as
unchristian, some Dissenters are in this
Controversy, being, such as Dr. <i>Harris</i>,
and Mr. <i>Atkinson</i>, no less for Persecution
than the <i>Clergy</i>. If they had a Regard
to their own Interests and Liberties, they
would be silent. Infidels (of whom I am
none) should be consider'd as Dissenting
Brethren, whom they should not be forward
to oppress, for fear in time, and by
degrees, it should come to their own
Turn. Our <i>Dissenters</i> indeed, collectively,
are vastly numerous, and a potent
Party, but may trust too much to their
own Strength and Numbers. Taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54_Book7" id="Page_54_Book7">[Pg 54]</a></span>
them separately, they may possibly be Extinguish'd
by Ecclesiastical Art and Craft.
If Blasphemy is a just Pretence for the
Prosecution of me, the <i>Clergy</i>, upon Occasion,
can urge the same Crime against
them. I'll tell them a Story. The <i>Calvinists</i>
and <i>Socinians</i> were once equally
tolerated in <i>Poland</i>, and if they had been
fast Friends to each other, the <i>Papists</i>
could never have suppress'd them: But
the <i>Calvinists</i> joining with the <i>Papists</i>,
and urging them to complain against the
<i>Socinians</i> for Blasphemy, in denying the
Divinity of the Son of God, moved the
Civil Authority to a Banishment of them;
and the <i>Socinians</i> had not been long suppress'd,
before the <i>Papists</i> accus'd the <i>Calvinists</i>
of no less Blasphemy, in denying
Adoration to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>; and so
they were sent packing too; otherwise
they might both have enjoy'd their Liberty
to this Day. The Application of
the Story is easy. So if all we <i>Dissenters</i>
from the Church, whether we like
one another's Principles or not, don't
hold together for the Preservation of our
Liberties, it's easy for Ecclesiasticks to
feign an Accusation of <i>Blasphemy</i> against
any of us. We have no Security, but in
the Wisdom and Goodness of an excellent
Government, which, if the <i>Clergy</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55_Book7" id="Page_55_Book7">[Pg 55]</a></span>
should ever get on the Back of, its hardly
a Question, whether they would not
drive, <i>Jehu</i> like, most furiously.</p>

<p>But to return to my <i>Bishop</i>. I once
thought he would never have been drawn
into this Controversy. Sometime after the
Publication of my Third <i>Discourse</i>, which,
for a visible Reason, I dedicated to him,
and invited him to Battle, I ask'd a dignify'd
<i>Clergy-man</i>, Whether the <i>Bishop</i>
would write against me? He answer'd,
No: Whereupon I concluded, that he
had a Scent of somewhat, not here to
be mention'd. But my repeated Provocations
of him afterwards, have forc'd him,
against Inclination, to engage me. His
Passion got the better of his Reason, or
he had been certainly quiescent: And the
Violence of his Passion is so visible thro'
his whole Book, that it's God's great
Mercy it did not throw him into a Fever
and Convulsions, to the Danger of his
Life and Health.</p>

<p>I own here again, what I have done before,
that I did lay a Trap for our <i>Clergy</i>;
but little imagined that two such great
<i>Bishops</i>, as of <i>London</i> and St. <i>David's</i>,
would, to my Pleasure and Satisfaction,
have been caught in it. If I had not baited
my Trap well with <i>Ridicule</i>, I dare say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56_Book7" id="Page_56_Book7">[Pg 56]</a></span>
they would have kept themselves clear
of it.</p>

<p>But when I experienc'd the hard Usage
the Bishops had given me upon my <i>Discourses</i>,
and the Fury with which they
attack'd me, it surprised me, and brought
to my Mind <i>Origen</i>'s Prediction<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> of
this <i>very</i> War and Controversy of the <i>Spirit</i>
against the <i>Letter</i> of the <i>Scriptures</i>,
and of the Violence it would be carried
on with. For all my Veneration for the
Authority of the Fathers, I did here suspect
the Truth of <i>Origen</i>'s Prediction, believing
him to be mistaken, and that the
Controversy would be manag'd in a <i>calm</i>,
<i>decent</i>, and <i>sedate</i> Manner; and so it had
been, but for the Interests of the <i>Clergy</i>
that are at Stake in it, which I was not
aware of. Finding then the Truth of <i>Origen</i>'s
Prediction contrary to my Expectations,
I had the Curiosity further to
consult the Fathers about the Issue of this
Controversy; and they presently, with
their mystical Fingers, pointed to a Prophecy
of it in the <i>Revelations</i> of St. <i>John</i>;
but, to say no more at present, assur'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57_Book7" id="Page_57_Book7">[Pg 57]</a></span>
me, that the <i>Spirit</i> would get the Better
of the <i>Letter</i> in the Conclusion of it.
Tho' I am accounted an Infidel, I am so
easy and credulous a Christian as to believe
all this; and I thank God have so
much Courage in me, as to try the Truth
of it.</p>

<p>But I must observe here, that besides my
two <i>Bishops</i>, of <i>London</i> and St. <i>David's</i>,
(and some other inconsiderable <i>Triflers</i>)
there are two <i>anonymous</i> Authors against
me, whose Works have acquir'd some Fame.
The One is intitled, <i>The Miracles of Jesus
vindicated</i>, in <i>Three Parts</i>. If I could
have gotten to the certain Knowledge of
the Author, I should have been tempted
to have had a Bout with him; and to
have expostulated with him, both with Regard
to his Arguments and good Manners.
I would have taught him a better
Use, and a more proper Application of
the Words <i>Dishonesty, and want of Honesty</i>,
than to reproach me with them.
Common Fame says, Dr. <i>Pearse</i>, of St.
<i>Martin's</i>, is the Author; but I am apt to
think, the <i>King</i>'s Parish Priest, and other
City <i>Divines</i>, have more Wit and Craft
than to upbraid me as above, for fear a
just Charge of <i>Dishonesty</i>, for their Extortions
and Exactions on the People,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58_Book7" id="Page_58_Book7">[Pg 58]</a></span>
should be retorted on them. Upon the
Publication of the <i>First Part</i> of the foresaid
Treatise, my <i>Jewish Rabbi</i> comes to
me in all haste, saying to me, "Look
you here, do you see how this Author
has new vampt the old <i>mumpsimus</i> Argument
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection? Do
you observe how imperfectly, here and
there, he answers my Objections to it;
and silently slips by some knotty Pieces
of them, that were too hard for him to
untie?" Yes, <i>Rabbi</i>, said I, I do observe
all this; (and what I have observ'd
since, he argues, awkwardly and backwardly,
for the Certainty of <i>Jesus</i>'s other
Miracles, from his Resurrection.) My <i>Rabbi</i>
presently re-inforc'd his Resurrection-Objection
against this Author, and would
have had me to print it. No, no, <i>Rabbi</i>,
said I; you may print it your self, if you
dare. I must wait to hear how Causes
will go in <i>Westminster-Hall</i>, next Term,
before I involve my self in another Law-Suit.
Besides, <i>Rabbi</i>, they say, I don't really
thus correspond with a <i>Jew</i>, but do
only personate one; and the <i>Bishop</i> of St.
<i>David's</i> hints, that I am answerable to
publick Justice for so doing. Here my
Rabbi stampt with Indignation; saying,
What if you did personate a <i>Jew</i>?
Is it not lawful, and in Use with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59_Book7" id="Page_59_Book7">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<i>Divines</i>, to write Conferences between a
Christian and a <i>Jew</i>? And do you any
more in this Case? Yes, <i>Rabbi</i>, said I, it
is lawful to write such like Conferences,
and to make <i>Jewish</i> Objections to Christianity,
when they are no stronger than
may be easily dissipated: But when Men
write from the Heart, as you do, and raise
a D&mdash;&mdash;l that our <i>Clergy</i> can't easily lay,
it is, they say, intolerable, and punishable;
and either you or I, in the Opinion
of the <i>Bishop</i>, ought to suffer for it.</p>

<p>The other considerable <i>Treatise</i> against
me, is that of <i>The Trial of the Witnesses
of the Resurrection of Jesus</i>; which is an
ingenious Piece, and I was well pleased
with it. Some time after the Publication
of this <i>Treatise</i>, I made my Jewish <i>Rabbi</i>
a Visit, when, drinking a <i>Dish</i> of <i>Tea</i>
together, we talk'd it over; and my <i>Rabbi</i>
was pleas'd to deliver his Sentiments of
it in this fashion: "Whoever was the
Author of this Treatise, God knows,
but he's certainly a Friend to my Objections
against <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection,
which he has fairly stated; but is so
far from fully confuting all of them,
that he discovers a Consciousness, here
and there, that they are unanswerable.
It is commonly reported that Bishop
<i>Sherlock</i> is the Author of this <i>Treatise</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60_Book7" id="Page_60_Book7">[Pg 60]</a></span>
but this Report I look upon as an Artifice
of the Booksellers, to make it sell
well; or rather the Author's contrived
<i>Banter</i> upon the <i>Clergy</i>, and their weak
Christian Brethren, to try how far they
may be imposed on, and drawn into
the Approbation and Admiration of a
Treatise, that really makes against them.
There is but very little in this Treatise,
to make it reputed a sufficient Answer
to my Objections, excepting the
Verdict of the <i>Jury</i>, who brought in
the Witnesses of the Resurrection, <i>Not
Guilty</i>, of either Fraud or Mistake in
it. <i>Bishop Sherlock</i> can't be the Author
of this Treatise, if for no other Reason
than this, that <i>that</i> Author is visibly
against that Ecclesiastical Wealth
and Power, which the <i>Bishop</i> is possess'd
of, and does think not disagreeable
to the Mind of Christ and his poor
Apostles. If any <i>Bishop</i> is the concealed
Author of this Treatise, he must secretly
be of the Opinion of the atheistical
Pope, who said, <i>quantum nobis
profuit h&aelig;c de Christo Fabula</i>, what vast
Advantage has the Story of Christ been
to us Popes and Bishops." I readily gave
into the Opinion of my <i>Rabbi</i>, and wonder'd,
<i>Bishop Sherlock</i> did not so much as by
a publick Advertisement clear himself of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61_Book7" id="Page_61_Book7">[Pg 61]</a></span>
being the Author of this Treatise, and so
put a Stop to the Report. It may be the
<i>Bishop</i> is above the Scandal of it; but I was
so concern'd for his Reputation, that I
drew up a <i>Vindication</i> of him from the
Slander of it; which I had publish'd, but
for my <i>Rabbi</i>'s farther Thoughts about
the Resurrection of Jesus inserted in it,
that our <i>Bishops</i> might have possibly taken
Offence at. So I dropp'd that Design at
present, but hope still for an Opportunity
to publish the said Vindication of the <i>Bishop</i>,
by which, I don't doubt, but to merit
his Friendship and Favour.</p>

<p>But whoever was the real Author of the
foresaid Treatise, I humbly and heartily
beg of him to publish, what in the Conclusion
of it, he has given us some Hopes
of, <i>The Trial of the Witnesses of the Resurrection
of</i> <span class="smcap">Lazarus</span>, because my
<i>Rabbi</i>'s Objections to it are a Novelty
and Curiosity, which, by way of such a
Reply to them, I should be glad to see
handled.</p>

<p>But having here by Chance mention'd
my <i>Rabbi</i>'s Letter concerning <i>Lazarus</i>'s
Resurrection, it brings to my Mind a
Challenge I made to the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i>
upon it, <i>viz.</i><a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> "If he would publish an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62_Book7" id="Page_62_Book7">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Answer to that Letter, and vouchsafe
me the Pleasure of a Reply to it; then
(to save the <i>Civil Magistrates</i> Trouble)
I would suffer such Punishment that
he in his Clemency should think fit to
inflict on me, for what's past." An ingenuous
<i>Clergy-man</i>, upon reading this,
said, that the <i>Bishop</i> was bound, in Honour,
to accept of my Challenge, or, what
was in his Power, in Generosity, to put a
Stop to the Prosecution. But the <i>Bishop</i>
is not of his Mind. And for what Reason
he does not accept of my Challenge,
is best known to himself, and others will
conjecture. If he had not condescended
to write against me in his <i>Pastoral Letter</i>,
I should have imagined, that he thought
it beneath the Dignity of One of his exalted
Station in the Church, to set his
Wit (for dignified Priests, for the most
part, think their Wit and Learning proportion'd
to their Wealth and Power) against
such a poor Author as I am. But
this is not the Reason. It may be, he
thinks his Reputation and Honour secure
in the Height of his Grandeur, and that
his Dependents will admire his Learning
nothing the less for his Neglect of my
Challenge. However it be, this I will say,
that were we upon the Level in the World
as to Fortune, as well as we are to Age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63_Book7" id="Page_63_Book7">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and Education, the Learned would despise
him for declining the reasonable Challenge
of one, whom he has injuriously
treated and persecuted. It's to no Purpose
to challenge him here afresh; he, being
purpos'd to carry the Matter with an high
Hand, has taken other Measures, and is
resolv'd to make use of his Power and Interest
to suppress him, whom with Reason
and Argument he can't convince.</p>

<p>However, I will here make another Proposal
to the <i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David's</i>. Because
he thirsts after a very severe Punishment
of me, or he would not be so warm
in his Exhortations of the Government
to that Purpose, I'll tell him how he may
glut his Revenge, and inflict a greater Punishment
on me, than, in all probability,
the Civil Magistrate will humour him in.
If he'll but put a Stop to the Prosecution
at present (which is not out of the Power
of our <i>Bishops</i>, whatever they may pretend)
and let the Controversy go on, till
I have finish'd my Reply to his <i>two Volumes</i>,
which shall be done with all Expedition;
then, if his Passion is not allay'd,
I will submit to any Punishment,
he in his Wisdom and Justice, without
Mercy, shall think fit to have laid on me,
whether it be to Death or Imprisonment.
And what would he, or any implacable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64_Book7" id="Page_64_Book7">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Priest, desire more? This Proposal makes
him my Judge as well as my Accuser,
and if he be not the most unreasonable
Man alive, he must accept of it. All my
Hopes here are, that his Reason may recover
its Dominion over his Passion, against
the Conclusion of my <i>Defence</i>, or
it will go hard with me. If the <i>Bishop</i>
will not comply with this Proposal, I shall
conclude, he's possess'd with the only certain
and allegorical <i>Satan</i>, mention'd in
my <i>Discourses</i>; and I shall be confirm'd
in the Opinion of St. <i>Hilary</i> (whose Testimonies
about Devils, the <i>Bishop</i> has silently
pass'd by, without any Charge upon
me for Misrepresentation) that there
are no worse <i>Devils</i> in the World, than
the calumniating, furious, and persecuting
Tempers of Mankind. The <i>Bishop</i>, by the
by, has taken Pains to prove there are other
<i>Devils</i>, of an infernal, frightful, and
independent Nature, and of a more certain
Existence than <i>Hobgoblins</i>; and he
gravely asserts, that three of those <i>Devils</i>
enter'd into each <i>Hog</i>, that ran violently
down-hill; thereby making the little
<i>Pigs</i> to carry as great a Burden as the old
<i>Boars</i> and <i>Sows</i>, which should have been
better thought of by him. The <i>Bishop</i>,
perhaps, for these my Descants, will say I
am an Infidel; but I assure him, it is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65_Book7" id="Page_65_Book7">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of the Articles of my Primitive and Christian
Faith, that the old <i>Dragon</i>, <i>Satan</i>,
the <i>Serpent</i>, or the <i>Devil</i>, mention'd in
the <i>Revelations</i>, is no other than the furious,
violent, and persecuting Spirit in
Man; which, upon the World's getting
Liberty of Religion, will be bound and
chain'd. And it is the Opinion of Thousands,
as well as of my self, that Mankind
will never be Happy, nor at Rest,
till this <i>Devil</i> is exorcised out of the Priesthood,
and so of consequence chain'd up.
According to the primitive Way of interpreting
the <i>Revelations</i> of St. <i>John</i>, the
Time is near at Hand for the <i>binding</i> this
Apocalyptical old <i>Dragon</i> or <i>Satan</i>, that
has pester'd the World through all Ages
past. All the Honour that I desire, is, by
my Studies and Endeavours to be contributing
to so great a Work, for the Good
and Happiness of Mankind.</p>

<p>To conclude. I have been the more expeditious
in printing of this Discourse,
not only for fear the <i>Bishop</i>'s <i>Vindication</i>
(as it is call'd) should have a <i>malign Influence</i>
upon some People, I don't mean
our <i>Civil Magistrates</i>, who are wiser and
more learned than to be guided by such
outragious Stuff; but because he should
not long triumph in a Conceit of the Potency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66_Book7" id="Page_66_Book7">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and Excellency of his Performance,
as if no Reply could or would be made
to it. If I had at this Time enjoy'd free
Liberty of Debate, I should not have
thought it worth my while to meddle
with his <i>Dedication</i>, which with a Scorn
I should have pass'd by, and left to the
Animadversions and Chastisement of other
Enemies to Persecution; but would immediately
have enter'd upon a Defence of
my <i>Discourses</i> against him. If I do retrieve
my Liberty, and the free Use of
my Pen, and should not publish Defences
of my self, I should deserve (what <i>one</i>
said the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i>, for his declining
my Challenge, deserv'd) to be piss'd upon
for a vain Pretender to Argument and Authority.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I have nothing to request
of our <i>Clergy</i>, but that Liberty of
Debate may be indulg'd us; <i>that</i> Liberty
of theological Disputation, which would
be granted, if they did not industriously
labour to obstruct it. When will they
cease to disgrace Truth, to dishonour their
Religion, and to disparage their own Education
and Learning; and no longer
envy Mankind the blessed Enjoyment of
such a Liberty!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67_Book7" id="Page_67_Book7">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>But their Religion, they say, would be
in Danger upon such a Liberty. How
can that be? How can Christianity be in
Danger, that has not only the Omnipotence
of God on his Side, but a numerous
standing Army of Priests, hired for the
Defence of it? It is not then their Concern
for Religion, that prompts them to so
much Zeal here; but their Fears for their
Interests, that depend on the Issue of this
Controversy.</p>

<p>Was I to write against any other honest
<i>Trade</i>, that is practised in this City, the
Artificers of it, being sensible of the Usefulness
of their Craft, would let me go on
unmolested; and only pity and despise me
for the Vanity of my Attempt to subvert
them: But the <i>Clergy</i>, being prick'd with
a Consciousness of the Mischiefs and Inconveniencies
of their Establishment, do
therefore thus winch and kick.</p>

<p>And who, besides the <i>Clergy</i>, are at this
time Enemies to Liberty? None hardly,
but their immediate Dependents, whom
they can easily infuse their fiery and furious
Notions into. Was it to be voted
this Day among the learned <i>Laity</i>, I dare
say, the Friends of Persecution would be
found vastly short of the Numbers of their
Adversaries. And I hope to God, the Legislative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68_Book7" id="Page_68_Book7">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Authority of these Nations will
soon take the Matter into their Consideration;
and either limit or enlarge the
Bounds of Liberty, that honest and well-meaning
Men may be no longer harrass'd
and molested, for their sincere Endeavours
to serve the Publick.</p>

<p>No Body, I trust, can complain of any
disrespectful Usage, I have here given the
<i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David's</i>, that considers, how
he has treated me in <i>his Sermon before the
Societies for Reformation</i>; and <i>in his
Charge to the Clergy of his Diocese</i>; as
well as <i>in his Vindication</i>. It would be
sufficient, if I had no other Excuse for
my self than <i>this</i>, That Controversy is
like a <i>Game</i> at <i>Foot ball</i>, in which, if a
<i>Lord</i> will engage with a <i>Plowman</i>, and
should meet with a Kick on the Shins, he
ought not to complain of the ill Manners
of it: So if a <i>Bishop</i> will dispute
with one of lower Degree, he must
look for a Rub on his Intellects, a Rap on
his Pate, and if his Adversary cuts him
on a soft Place, he should know how to
bear it with Patience. But the <i>Bishop</i>, contrary
to this <i>Game-Rule</i> in Controversy,
complains<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> of my <i>unmannerly</i> Treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69_Book7" id="Page_69_Book7">[Pg 69]</a></span>
of him, and cries out of the Sufferings
and Reproaches he undergoes, as if
he was already more than half a Martyr
for Religion. I can't pretend to equal him
in Reproaches and Sufferings, having not
so quick a Sense of them; and therefore I
am willing, that good Christian People
should pity my poor <i>Bishop</i>, rather than
me, in a persecuted and sorrowful Condition.</p>

<p>How long it will be, before I publish
another, and <i>second</i> Part of my <i>Defence</i>,
is uncertain, for a Reason, that I need not
again mention. But if it please God, that
I enjoy Life, Health, and Liberty, I'll go
on with my Designs. I am resolv'd to give
the <i>Letter</i> of the Scriptures no Rest, so
long as I am able by Reason and Authority
to disturb it. If our Ministers of the
<i>Letter</i> will not ascend with me, the sublime
and allegorical <i>Mountain</i> of divine
Contemplation, they than have no Comfort
nor Enjoyment of themselves in the
low <i>Valley</i> of the <i>Letter</i>, if I can disquiet
them. Notwithstanding what the <i>Bishop</i>
has written in <i>Vindication</i> of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles,
the litteral Story of them, by the
Leave of God, and of the Civil Magistrate,
shall be afresh attack'd, and perhaps
with more <i>Ridicule</i>, than I used before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70_Book7" id="Page_70_Book7">[Pg 70]</a></span>
What should I flinch for? The litteral
Story of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles is not, in
the Opinion of the Fathers, as well as of
my self, agreeable to Sense and Reason;
neither can <i>Jesus</i>'s Authority and Messiahship
be founded on the <i>Letter</i> of them.
I am not for the <i>Messiahship</i> of a carnal
<i>Jesus</i>, who cured the bodily Diseases of
Blindness and Lameness; but for Messiahship
of the spiritual <i>Jesus</i>, who will
cure the Blindness and Lameness of our
Understandings. I am for the Messiahship
of the spiritual <i>Jesus</i>, who will expel the
mercenary Preachers out of his Church,
after the manner that <i>Jesus</i> in the Flesh
is supposed to have driven the Sellers out
of the Temple, which litterally is but a
sorry Story. I am for the Messiahship of
the spiritual <i>Jesus</i>, who exorcised the furious
and persecuting Devils out of the
Mad-men of <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>; and tho'
he permitted them to enter into a Herd of
Ecclesiastical Swine, yet will precipitate
them into the Sea of Divine Knowledge.
I am for the spiritual <i>Jesus</i>, who will
cure the <i>Woman</i> of the Church, of her
<i>Issue of Blood</i>, that is shed in Persecution
and War; which her Ecclesiastical Physicians,
and Quack-Doctors of the <i>Clergy</i>,
have not been able to do, tho' they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71_Book7" id="Page_71_Book7">[Pg 71]</a></span>
received large Fees and Revenues to that
End. I am for a spiritual <i>Messiah</i>, who
will cure the Woman of the Church of
her <i>Infirmity</i>, at the Spirit of Prophecy,
of whose Infirmity this Age is her <i>eighteenth</i>
Year. So could I write of all <i>Jesus</i>'s
Miracles; for the whole Evangelical
History is Figure and Shadow of the
spiritual <i>Jesus</i>, whom we should <i>know to
be in us of a Truth, unless we be Reprobates</i>.
The <i>Clergy</i>, if they are not wilfully
blind, may hence see my Christian
Faith and Principles; and be assured, that
what I do in this Controversy, is with a
View to the Honour of God, the Advancement
of Truth, the Edification of the
Church, and Demonstration of the Messiahship
of the Holy <i>Jesus</i>, to whom be
Glory for ever. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>hat I am no Flatterer
of <i>Patrons</i>, appears by
my other <i>Dedications</i>: If
therefore I should tell
your <i>Lordship</i>, what I can
in Sincerity, that I think you as
wise and good a Magistrate, as any
of your <i>Predecessors</i> in that <i>High Court</i>
of <i>Justice</i>, you may be assured, I
don't dissemble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv_Book8" id="Page_iv_Book8">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>Tho' I was so unfortunate, <i>My
Lord</i>, as to receive a Sentence in
your Court, which I wish'd to
avoid; yet I have no worse Opinion
of your Wisdom and Justice.
Your Conduct towards me, from
first to last, has rather heighten'd
than lessen'd my Esteem and Veneration
for you. I observ'd in you
such a Tenderness for our religious
Liberties; such an Aversion to Persecution;
and such Moderation
towards my self, that if I had
been absolutely acquitted, it would
have been but with somewhat more
Satisfaction.</p>

<p>And if I now write to clear my
self of all Suspicions of Infidelity,
for which I was sentenced; your
<i>Lordship</i>, I humbly presume, will
not think the worse of me. It is not
expected that the Innocent should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v_Book8" id="Page_v_Book8">[Pg v]</a></span>
confess Guilt, in a Compliment to
any Court of Justice: Nor does the
Condemnation of the Guiltless, at
any time almost, so much affect the
Justice of the Magistrate, as the
Honesty of the Evidence: So I,
<i>My Lord</i>, know how to lay the
Blame entirely on my Ecclesiastical
Accusers, and believe your <i>Lordship</i>
will be rather pleas'd than
offended at any good Defence I can
make for my self.</p>

<p>From the Beginning of the Prosecution
against me, <i>my Lord</i>, I hardly
believed, that any Sentence would
be pass'd on me, till the Day I received
it: And the Reason was, not
only because the good Tendency of
my <i>Discourses</i> was so visible, that I
thought it could not be overlook'd
by the Wise and Learned; but because
I imagin'd our <i>Bishops</i> would
have better consulted their Reputation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi_Book8" id="Page_vi_Book8">[Pg vi]</a></span>
than to let Matters come to
this Issue.</p>

<p>That it is a Transgression of the
Law of the Land to write against
Christianity, establish'd in it, I'll
not question, since I have your
<i>Lordship</i>'s Word for it: But for all
that, I could wish, for the Sake of
Christianity, that such a Liberty
was indulg'd to <i>Infidels</i>. Whatever
our zealous <i>Clergy</i> may think, one
Persecution of an <i>Infidel</i> does more
Harm to Religion, than the Publication
of the worst <i>Book</i> against
it.</p>

<p>Liberty is so essential, <i>My Lord</i>,
to the Enquiry after Truth, that
where It is wanted, Truth will want
that Splendor, which it receives
from Disputation: And Christianity
would be the more tryumphant
over its Enemies, for that unbounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii_Book8" id="Page_vii_Book8">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Liberty, they may enjoy to contest
it from the <i>Press</i>. I say this,
not for the Security of my self;
against future Prosecutions but,
from a Heart, full of Zeal for the
Religion of the Holy <i>Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>Ever since the <i>Reformation</i>, which
was founded on our Natural and
Christian Rights to Liberty of Conscience,
has this great Blessing of
Liberty, at Times, been interrupted
by Persecutions: But whether any
of them hitherto have done any
Service to <i>Church</i> or <i>State</i>, your
<i>Lordship</i> is a good Judge.</p>

<p>However, tho' the Prosecution
of my self, which was founded on
a grand Mistake, is attended with
no ill Consequence; yet I hope
our <i>Ecclesiasticks</i> will grow cautious
by it, and no more sollicit the most
indulgent Civil Magistracy of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii_Book8" id="Page_viii_Book8">[Pg viii]</a></span>

</div>

<p>t's Time now to publish
another <i>Part</i> of my <i>Defence</i>,
which, in my former,
I gave my <i>Readers</i>
some Reason to expect
from me. If I should
keep Silence much longer,
my <i>Adversaries</i> will be ready to charge
me with Cowardice, or Insufficiency; and
say, that I'm either absolutely confuted by
the <i>Writers</i> against me, or so terrified by
the Civil Magistrate's Authority, that I
either can't, or dare not, engage afresh in
the same Cause. And I must confess, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_Book8" id="Page_2_Book8">[Pg 2]</a></span>
if I was not convinced of the Goodness
of my Cause, which is no other than God's,
and of my Ability to defend it, I should
chuse to hold my Peace, and be glad that
it has fared no worse with me.</p>

<p>One Reason indeed why I have been
so long ere I publish'd <i>this</i>, is pure Respect
to the Civil Powers, whom I am
oblig'd, as a Christian, to honour and reverence,
so far as may be, without Disobedience
to God. Had I hastily, and as soon
almost as <i>Sentence</i> was pass'd on me, publish'd
<i>this</i>, some might have interpreted
it, as an Act of Defiance and Contempt
of the Civil Authority, (for there are not
wanting those who will put the worst
Construction they can on my Conduct;)
therefore I forbore for a while: And now
that I appear again from the <i>Press</i>, it is
not without professing a profound Veneration
for our Civil Magistracy, who, I
am sure, will never think the worse of a
Man for vindicating his own Innocency,
or for writing in a Cause that, in his Conscience,
he is persuaded is most just and
good.</p>

<p>Another Reason why I committed this
no sooner to the Press, was to wait the
Publication of the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s
his <i>Second Volume</i>, which he promised us
last Winter. I was almost of Opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_Book8" id="Page_3_Book8">[Pg 3]</a></span>
that, in my former <i>Defence</i>, I gave the
<i>Bishop</i> such Intimations of my sincere Belief
of Christianity, notwithstanding my
<i>Discourses</i> on <i>Miracles</i>, and of the Falseness
of his repeated Charge against me
for Infidelity, that I question'd whether
he would write again in the same Strain.
If the <i>Bishop</i> is convinced of this his grand
Mistake about me, then the very Foundation
of his past and future Work is shaken,
and I shall hear no more of him. But
whether he is certainly convinc'd of his
Mistake or not, I am concern'd to go on
with these <i>Defences</i> of my self, and to
vindicate the Goodness and Usefulness of
the Design of my <i>Discourses</i> on <i>Miracles</i>,
against what the <i>Bishops</i> of <i>London</i> and
<i>St. David</i>'s, and other <i>Adversaries</i> have
written to the contrary.</p>

<p>But, before I enter upon such a <i>Defence</i>
of my self and my <i>Discourses</i>, I must
make, what is proper here, a short Preface.
It is well known, that I am for
Liberty of Debate, and against all Persecution
or Force, or Impositions on the
Consciences of Mankind. But for all that,
there are some <i>Rules</i> in Controversy that
we polemical <i>Writers</i> should observe, and
be oblig'd to; or, instead of discovering
and illustrating the Truth we pretend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_Book8" id="Page_4_Book8">[Pg 4]</a></span>
search for, we shall but the more darken,
obstruct and perplex it. As,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, We should endeavour to write as
plainly and intelligibly as we can, and never
amuse our <i>Readers</i> with Expressions
void of Sense, or with false Reasoning
against our <i>Adversaries</i>, where we want
what's good and solid. This <i>Rule</i> none
can except against: Whether I am an Observer
of this <i>Rule</i>, my Readers are to be
Judges. As I am to answer it to God
and a good Conscience, I endeavour to
observe it; but much question, whether
some of my <i>Adversaries</i> can say so too,
or they would never vent such dark, impertinent
and unintelligible Stuff, if it was
not, because they are at a Loss for what's
clear and shining. There's no End of giving
Instances out of their Writings to this
Purpose. I shall only mention one, that's
repeated amongst them, and that is, of
their pretended Distinction between Popish
<i>Persecution</i> and Protestant <i>Prosecution</i> for
Opinions, wherewith they have amused
weak and injudicious Heads. The Wife, I
am sure, can discern no more Difference
here, than between a <i>Rope</i> and a <i>Halter</i>
to hang an innocent Man, in which Case
too there is a <i>nominal</i> Distinction without
a <i>real</i> Difference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5_Book8" id="Page_5_Book8">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, We should be open and sincere
in our Opinions, and not profess with
our Mouths to believe, what we disown
in our Hearts; nor, like <i>Watermen</i>, that
look one way and row another, should we
pretend to have one Design in View, when
we are pursuing the quite contrary. This
is a reasonable <i>Rule</i>, and ought to be observ'd,
or we shall confound the Understandings
of our <i>Readers</i>, who will soon
lose Sight of our Arguments, if they apprehend
not their Aim and Drift. This
<i>Rule</i>, my Adversaries will say, is levell'd
at my self, than whom no body has more
dissembled and prevaricated in his Opinions.
Have not you, will they say to me,
frequently declared, that your Design in
your <i>Discourses</i> is to make way for the
Proof of the Truth of Christianity, and
of the Messiahship of the Holy <i>Jesus</i>,
when you mean and intend the Subversion
of both? And is not here grand Hypocrisy,
and a Transgression of this Rule?
Yes, if I intend the Subversion of Christ's
Religion and Messiahship, here is grand
Hypocrisy, and a Transgression of this
<i>Rule</i>; and I can't think of such a Piece of
Prevarication without Horror. The Bishop
of <i>St. David</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> and Mr. <i>Stackhouse</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6_Book8" id="Page_6_Book8">[Pg 6]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
in particular, have animadverted
upon me for such Hypocrisy; and if I
was guilty of it, in much gentler Terms
than I deserv'd. This Hypocrisy, which
they falsely charge me with, is as heinous
a Sin as I can think of; it is as bad as
wilful <i>Perjury</i>, as bad as a <i>Clergyman</i>'s taking
the Abjuration Oath, with his Heart
full of Zeal and Affection for the Pretender,
and worse than his giving his solemn Assent
and Consent to Articles of Religion
he believes little or nothing of. I should
hardly have mention'd this <i>Rule</i> to be observ'd
in Controversy, if I had been guilty
of the Breach of it. It is somewhat excusable
in <i>Infidels</i> a little to disguise their
real Sentiments, for fear of the Danger
they may incur by an open Profession of
them: But such a gross and foul Mask of
Hypocrisy, as some think I have here put
on, is intolerable, and must be hateful to
<i>Infidels</i> as well as <i>Christians</i>, being obstructive
to Truth, which, in all Inquirers
after her, loves Sincerity and Simplicity.
No doubt, but my <i>Adversaries</i>, some of
them, will still think me a Transgressor
of this <i>Rule</i>; but my present and following
<i>Defences</i> will absolutely clear me. And
if none of my <i>Adversaries</i> are more guilty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7_Book8" id="Page_7_Book8">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of the Transgression of it than my self,
we are all entirely innocent.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, In Controversy we should avoid
all wilful Misrepresentation of the Sense
of our <i>Adversaries</i>, and of the <i>Authors</i>
we pretend to cite. Mistakes and Misapprehensions
of one another will sometimes
unavoidably happen, and are then
as innocent things as involuntary Errors.
But wilful Perversion and Falsification of
another Author's Words, to the Service of
our selves, or to the Prejudice of our <i>Adversaries</i>,
is most blameable, and of that
ill Consequence to the Search after Truth,
that it will keep us always at a Distance
from her. This then is another good
<i>Rule</i> to be observed in Controversy, which
some may wonder I have mention'd, because
of that Misrepresentation and Falsification
of Authorities I am charg'd with.
And I must confess, my <i>Adversaries</i> have
here made an hideous Outcry against me;
which if I can't acquit my self of, I am
the foulest Controvertist that ever appear'd
in Print. The Bishop of <i>St. David</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
calls my <i>Falsification</i> of Authorities, an
<i>Immorality</i>, and speculative <i>Forgery</i>; but
if I was so guilty as he would have me
thought, he speaks too favourably of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8_Book8" id="Page_8_Book8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
He should have deem'd it as great a Crime
as practical <i>Forgery</i> by the Law; and all
Philosophers and Lovers of Truth should
wish it might be likewise punish'd.</p>

<p>But, good Christian Reader, don't too
hastily pass thy Judgment on me. Suspend
awhile; it may be, that I may unexpectedly
vindicate my self. The Matter
as yet is under Debate, whether my
<i>Adversaries</i> or I are the grand Misrepresenters
and Falsifiers of Authorities. One
would think, that my Adversaries, who
were bent on the Accusation of me for the
foresaid Crime, should have kept themselves
clear of it: But the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
is such a resolute <i>Misrepresenter</i>, that
he could not find in his Heart faithfully to
transcribe the <i>Three Heads</i> of my <i>Discourses</i>;
but by a Suppression of some Words,
and the Change of others, has given them
an odious and invidious Turn to my Disadvantage:
And he has studied so hard
to pervert the Sense of the Fathers against
me, and so tortured his Brain to make
me a Misrepresenter of them, that I should
not wonder, if he had labour'd under a
Pain in his Head ever since, and is unable
to write more. Tho' my Word should
not be taken for all this at present; yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9_Book8" id="Page_9_Book8">[Pg 9]</a></span>
in the Sequel of these <i>Defences</i>, it will
be made manifest.</p>

<p>It is a great Temptation to our <i>Bishops</i>
falsely to accuse and misrepresent their
Adversaries; because they know their
Writings don't equally spread and go together
among all their Readers. A <i>Bishop</i>'s
Writing going more by itself amongst the
<i>Clergy</i>, and other Friends to his Side of
the Question, he is tempted to misrepresent
his Adversaries, knowing his prejudiced
Readers will take his Report of them, and
credit it. For this Reason, and no other,
did the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Litchfield</i><a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> falsely charge
the <i>Author</i> of the <i>Grounds</i> with odious
Assertions, to which there is nothing akin
in the Places seemingly referr'd to, nor in
all that Author's Work.</p>

<p>However, the <i>Rule</i> in Controversy before
laid down is a good, useful and necessary
one. I pray God we may all be
religious and conscientious Observers of it,
or we shall retard the Discovery of Truth,
and render our Attainment of it difficult,
if not impossible.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, We should think our selves
oblig'd to set our Names to our Writings
in Controversy, especially where it is such
a <i>warm</i> one as is ours at present. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10_Book8" id="Page_10_Book8">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Observation of this <i>Rule</i> would not only
prevent much of the Violation of the <i>two</i>
former; but would hinder abundance of
the Dirt of Scandal, Lies and Defamations,
that we too often throw at each other.
For what Reason some of the <i>Writers</i><a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
against me have industriously conceal'd
their Names, I know full well. They perhaps
would have it thought Modesty, and
that they are not ambitious of the publick
Praises they may deserve for their learned
and elaborate Performances. And possibly
it may be Modesty in some Theological
Authors to conceal themselves: But
where Men have the Impudence to defame,
it's in vain to pretend to the Cloak
of Modesty to cover themselves under.
Wherefore then do they sometimes who
write on the establish'd Side of the Question,
on which Honour and Preferment
goes, thus conceal themselves? Why, that
they might belie and slander their Adversaries
the more securely, without being
expostulated with for their Impudence. It's
to no Purpose, they know, to upbraid an
anonymous Author with his Scandal, because
he can't be put to the Blush for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11_Book8" id="Page_11_Book8">[Pg 11]</a></span>
And a wise Man will not lose his Labour
to expose and confute a libellous Writing,
unless he knew whom to charge with the
Guilt of it. It is my Resolution to take
no Notice of any nameless Authors against
me, because I, being as it were blindfolded,
engage them at a Disadvantage, whilst
they have a full View of me. For this
Reason the <i>Tryal of the Witnesses</i> was
pass'd by, or I should have been tempted
to have made some Remarks on it. Let
such <i>Authors</i> come forth into the Light,
and it may be, they'll meet with the same
Favour I have done the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s.
In the mean time, I declare my
Abhorrence of Authors their Concealment
of their Names, and I hope all ingenuous
<i>Writers</i> in Controversy will do so too; tho'
for no other Reason, than to prevent Misrepresentations,
Defamations, and personal
Reflections, which nameless Authors are
too often guilty of.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, and <i>lastly</i>, Others make it a
common <i>Rule</i> to be observ'd in Controversy,
that the <i>Disputants</i> should consider
each other's Arguments impartially,
without the Byass of Prejudice and Interest.
And a very good <i>Rule</i> this is, if
Men would but put it into Practice. But
I shall long despair of such Impartiality
in Controversy. Such is the Power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12_Book8" id="Page_12_Book8">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Prejudice and Interest, that they will influence
Men to believe against the most
apparent Reason and Truth. Even Prejudice
will much darken the Eyes of Mens
Understandings, but Interest will put them
quite out. O what a horrible Obstacle
to the free Enquiry after Truth, is Interest!
Against Demonstration itself will Men
contend for Interest. Interest, upon Occasion,
will induce them to desert the best
Opinions, and keep them tight to the
worst. This Experience proves true, and
the various Faces of the Church, and
Changes of the <i>Clergy</i> (all for Interest) is
a Witness of it. God forbid that I should
judge uncharitably of the Corruption of
human Nature under the Power of Interest;
but I believe, that was our <i>Legislature</i>
to do, what they never will, that is,
set up the Figure of a <i>Calf</i> in our Churches,
there would be no want of Priests to
worship him, if they were well paid for
it; nor of Academical <i>Students</i> to prove
his divine Power and Godship, if the Road
to Preferment lay that Way. For this
Reason, among many others, I am for the
Abolition of an hired and establish'd Priesthood,
that this grand Bar of Interest may
be removed out of our Way to Truth.
And the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i>, that excellent
Prelate, as <i>Bishop Smalbroke</i> calls him (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13_Book8" id="Page_13_Book8">[Pg 13]</a></span>
so do we, like other Creatures, knab one
another where it itches) should by rights
be of my Mind, saying,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> "Where there
is an Unwillingness to part with worldly
Interests, there must of Course be a <i>Desire</i>
that the Christian Religion should
not be true; and a <i>Willingness</i> to favour
and embrace any Argument that
is brought against it, and to cherish any
Doubts and Scruples that shall be rais'd
concerning it." So feelingly does this
<i>Bishop</i> speak of the Power of Interest, by
which, as I would conceive, he honestly
hints to the Inhabitants of <i>London</i> and
<i>Westminster</i>, that the <i>Bishop</i> of their Diocese,
and the <i>Parson</i> of their Parish, are
most unfit Guides in Religion, because of
the worldly Interests they may have to
deceive them, and keep them in Ignorance
and Error.</p>

<p>Thus by way of Preface having spoken
to the foregoing <i>Rules</i> to be observed in
this Controversy, I come to a close. <i>Defence</i>
of myself against the Charge of Infidelity,
and to vindicate the Usefulness of
my <i>Discourses on Miracles</i> for the Proof
of the Truth of Christianity, and of the
Messiahship of the Holy <i>Jesus</i>, against
all my Adversaries. And the Method I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14_Book8" id="Page_14_Book8">[Pg 14]</a></span>
shall take to this Purpose, is this following.</p>

<p>I. To show the Weakness, Childishness,
and Insufficiency of the Arguments of my
<i>Adversaries</i>, for the <i>Letter</i> of the Stories
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles; and further to prove
both <i>ludicrously</i> and <i>seriously</i> the Absurdities,
Incredibilities, and Improbabilities,
that their literal Stories labour under.</p>

<p>II. To prove, that whether there be
any Sense, Truth and Fact, or not, in the
Letter of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles; yet they are
Typical Things, and ought to be allegorically
interpreted, and will receive a mysterious
and more wonderful Accomplishment,
after the manner, and to the same
Purpose, that the Fathers and I do apply
them, being no other (whether actually
wrought or not) than Figures, Signs and
Emblems of his future and mysterious
Operations.</p>

<p>III. To show that the mysterious and
future Accomplishment of these supposed
Works and Miracles of <i>Jesus</i> alone can
and will be the Proof of his Messiahship.</p>

<p>If I perform well upon these Heads,
which are deserving of my <i>Reader</i>'s Review,
because of their Pertinency to the
Cause in Hand, I shall not only vindicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15_Book8" id="Page_15_Book8">[Pg 15]</a></span>
myself from the Charge of Infidelity, but
justify the Goodness and Usefulness of my
<i>Discourses</i>, in order to the Demonstration
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship. And in the midst
of my handling of them, without going
out of my Way, I shall, as Occasion offers
itself, take Notice of particular Misrepresentations
of the Fathers, and false Citations
out of them, that my Adversaries
charge me with: And Bishop <i>Smalbroke</i>
and others had best to look to it, or their
Accusations against me will recoil and return
home to them. Then</p>

<p>I. I should show the Weakness, Childishness
and Insufficiency of the Arguments
of my <i>Adversaries</i> for the <i>Letter</i> of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Miracles; and further argue both <i>ludicrously</i>
and <i>seriously</i> the Absurdities, Incredibilities
and Improbabilities, that their
literal Stories labour under.</p>

<p>I should, I say, first treat on this Head,
which naturally precedes the two following;
but in as much as to handle it to
Perfection, I should write as I did before,
and shall run in Danger of Prosecution
for Blasphemy and Infidelity; I must of
Necessity wave and postpone it, unless I
could more than dispatch it in the Compass
of this <i>Part</i> of my <i>Defence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16_Book8" id="Page_16_Book8">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>I have heretofore made solemn Professions
of my Belief of Christianity, and most
seriously declared in the plainest Terms,
that my Design was not to do Service to
Infidelity, but to make way for the Proof
of Christ's Religion and Messiahship; but
my Word was not taken, being look'd upon
as a Dissembler, an Hypocrite, and
Prevaricator, for all that. And should I
now ever so gravely repeat the like Asseverations
of the Integrity and Sincerity of
my Heart, that my Objections against the
Letter of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles are none against
his Religion, but only intended to turn
Mens Heads to the mystical Interpretations
of them; I question much whether I
should be believed, and whether <i>Bishop
Smalbroke</i><a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> would not say again, <i>that
this is too thin a Disguise of what seems
to be my great and worse Design</i>. What
then in Prudence must I do in this Case?
Why, I must let <i>This Head</i>, which reasonably
should precede, rest for a while;
and by treating on the <i>Second</i>, tho' out
of Place, I must first effectually convince
my Adversaries, that I am no <i>Infidel</i> of
wicked Designs to subvert Christianity, but
only the <i>Ministry of the Letter</i>; and then,
I conceive, I may safely resume the Consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17_Book8" id="Page_17_Book8">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of this <i>First Head</i>, and without
the Imputations of Infidelity and Blasphemy,
write as <i>merrily</i> or <i>gravely</i> as I please
against the Letter.</p>

<p>Should any say, that this pretended
Reason for waving this <i>First Head</i> for the
present, is nothing but Cowardice and Inability
to write more on it, I can't help
it. <i>Ictus Piscator sapit</i>; I have already
suffer'd much for the ludicrous Treatment
of the <i>Letter</i>, and it is Wisdom to keep,
if I can, out of the like Danger; neither
will I do any thing, that in Conscience I
can forbear, to incur the Displeasure of
the Civil Magistrate. But however, if
the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i> would ensure me
against, what the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s calls,
the<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> <i>Nominal</i> Persecutions of <i>Protestants</i>,
which I am more afraid of, than of the <i>real</i>
Persecutions of <i>Papists</i>, I will soon enter
upon this Head; otherwise for Self-Preservation
against the <i>nominal</i> Sufferings of
Fines and Imprisonment, <i>&amp;c.</i> I will forbear,
promising my Readers, that in due
Time, and on a more proper Occasion, I
will resume the <i>merry Subject</i> of the <i>Letter</i>,
and handle it to their entire Satisfaction.</p>

<p>And when I resume <i>this Head</i>, I will begin
where I before left off in my <i>Discourses</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18_Book8" id="Page_18_Book8">[Pg 18]</a></span>
on <i>Miracles</i>; that is, with the Resurrection
of <i>Jesus</i>, which tho' I believe to have
been a miraculous Fact, that happen'd,
yet it was by no means timed and circumstanced,
so as easily and readily to conciliate
the Belief of Posterity. God has
given to Man Reason to judge of the Credibility of
Events, and the Certainty of
Miracles: And if the Reason of every Man
does not disapprove of the Management
of that Event, (supposing it has no figurative
Meaning in it) I am much mistaken,
when we come to state a Case, how
such a Miracle ought to be wrought and
conducted, to get and preserve the Credit
of it.</p>

<p>Thus having told my Readers, why I
postpone my <i>First Head</i>, I now enter upon
the <i>Second</i>, which is</p>

<p>II. To shew, that whether there be any
Sense, Truth and Fact, or not, in the literal
Stories of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, yet they
are all certainly typical Facts, and ought
to be allegorically interpreted, and will
receive a mysterious and more wonderful
Accomplishment after the Manner, and
to the same Purpose, that the Fathers and
I do apply them, being no other (whether
actually wrought or not) than Figures,
Signs and Emblems of his future and mysterious
Operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19_Book8" id="Page_19_Book8">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>If the Authority of the Fathers would
be admitted of, as decisive on <i>this Head</i>,
there would soon be an End of all Controversy
upon it. Give me Leave to recite
some of their Testimonies to this Purpose,
which I have heretofore urg'd in my <i>Discourses</i>.
<i>Origen</i> says<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> That <i>Jesus</i>'s
Works were <i>Symbols</i> of other Things to
be done by his Power. St. <i>Hilary</i><a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
says, That <i>Jesus</i>'s Actions bore a Resemblance
of what he would do hereafter.
St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> says, That the Facts of
<i>Jesus</i> are Signs of somewhat else to be
done by him. And <i>Eusebius Gallicanus</i><a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
says, That our Saviour manifestly shews,
that his Miracles are of a spiritual Signification,
or in the Work of them he would
not have done somewhat or other, that
seems to want Sense and Reason. These
few, out of a Multitude of Citations from
the Fathers that might be produced, are
sufficient to the Proof of the present Proposition,
if their Authority might determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20_Book8" id="Page_20_Book8">[Pg 20]</a></span>
our Dispute. And most pertinent
Citations they are too, tho' <i>Bishop Smalbroke</i><a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
says, <i>that even the Passages cited
by me from the Fathers, that are not falsified,
are impertinent</i>; which is such an extravagant
Stretch against the most glaring Truth,
that (to use the Bishop's<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> own Words
against himself) <i>it betrays a Mind lost to all
Sense of Modesty and Religion</i>, or he could
not have utter'd it.</p>

<p>And not only the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i> were
Signs and Figures of future Events; but,
according to <i>Origen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> <i>every thing else
that he did</i>: From whence we may gather
what was <i>Origen</i>'s Meaning, when
he said<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> <i>Christ's first</i> Advent in the Flesh
is all Type and Shadow of his <i>second</i>, spiritual,
and glorious Coming; which being
an <i>Opinion</i> that our <i>Clergy</i> are Strangers to,
I desire them to consider of it, and whether
there is any Possibility of Truth in
it, because it is contrary to modern Conceptions
about <i>Christ's second</i> Advent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21_Book8" id="Page_21_Book8">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Nay further, according to the Fathers,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
the very Life and Ministry of <i>John</i>
the <i>Baptist</i>, so far as it is recorded by the
<i>Evangelists</i>, is Type and Figure of another's
Ministry before Christ's spiritual
Advent; and I am almost, if not altogether
of the same Mind with them. It is
beside my present Business, to insert here
many of their Testimonies to this Purpose:
But if the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s would
spare a little Time, which can't be better
employ'd, and make a Collection of the
Opinions of the Fathers about the <i>Baptist</i>'s
Ministry, and print it, I dare say he'll
thereupon present the learned World with
the most surprizing Curiosity they ever
were entertain'd with. Tho' it is improper
for me to do such a Work; yet I will here
tell my <i>Readers</i> what will be the true
Meaning of <i>John's Preaching Repentance,
for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand</i>,
when his Ministry revives, <i>viz.</i> "It will
be an Exhortation to Ministers of the
Letter, μετανοειν, to reconsider the Matter
and Error of their literal Expositions,
and to betake themselves to spiritual
and allegorical Interpretations of
the Scriptures, in which allegorical and
spiritual Senses of them consists the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22_Book8" id="Page_22_Book8">[Pg 22]</a></span>
<i>Kingdom of Heaven</i>." This I assert upon
the Authority of <i>Origen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and if
the <i>Clergy</i> please to consult St. <i>Austin</i> and
others, they'll find them of the same Mind.
But, this by the by, having no more to
say to the Typicalness of <i>John</i>'s Ministry,
than whenever his foresaid mystical Preaching
of Repentance shall revive, it can hardly
be to a more viperous Generation of
Ecclesiastical <i>Scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i>, than are
the <i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Letter</i> at this present.</p>

<p>But against all these, and Ten Thousand
more Testimonies of the Fathers for
the allegorical Interpretation of the Writings
of the <i>Evangelists</i>, and of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Miracles in particular, the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St.
David</i>'s says, the Fathers are not of good
Authority in this Case, but, for all them,
who were Men of whimsical and volatile
Fancies, we ought to adhere to the <i>Letter</i>
of the Story of <i>Christ</i>'s Life and Miracles.
This the <i>Bishop</i> asserts roundly and
frequently in express or implicit Terms, as
his Readers may observe; and I dare say,
the <i>Bishop</i> himself will not here charge me
with a Misrepresentation of his Opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23_Book8" id="Page_23_Book8">[Pg 23]</a></span>
tho', to spare Time and Paper, I quote
not his own Words and large Passages.</p>

<p>What Reason does the <i>Bishop</i> give, why
the Authority of the Fathers for the allegorical
Interpretation of the Evangelical
Writings, and of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, in particular,
is not to be allow'd of? None at
all. Does he quote so much as a Canon
of the Church, or a Vote in Convocation,
or an Act of Parliament, or the consentient
Opinion of all Protestant <i>Writers</i>
(which are the extrascriptural Standards
of modern Orthodoxy) for his Opinion?
No. Does he then reject the Authority of
the Fathers in all other Cases, as well as
in <i>this</i> before us? Nor this neither. He
allows their Authority,<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> as they were
good Persons and credible Witnesses, "In
Testimony of <i>Facts</i>; "And about the Observation
of the Lord's Day; "And concerning
the three Orders of the <i>Clergy</i>; "And
about the Government of the Church by
Bishops; "And about the Books received
into the Canon of the Scripture;" But as
for allegorical Interpretations of the Scriptures,
they are of <i>little</i>, and (elsewhere)
of <i>no</i> Authority. Who can forbear smiling,
unless the <i>Bishop</i> had better <i>evinced</i>
the Reason of this Difference in their Authority?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24_Book8" id="Page_24_Book8">[Pg 24]</a></span>
If he had rejected their Authority
in all Cases, he would have judged
more equally and impartially of it.</p>

<p>In my Opinion, and I appeal to my <i>Readers</i>,
whether it ben't their Opinion, that
the <i>Bishop</i> had been an ingenuous and
plain Dealer, if he had express'd himself
about the Authority of the Fathers in this
following Manner, saying, "That the
Authority of the Fathers is good in <i>such</i>
and <i>such</i> Cases as aforesaid; because
their Authority is agreeable enough to
the present Doctrine, Practice and Discipline
of the Church: But the Authority
of the Fathers is not good for the
allegorical Interpretation of the <i>New
Testament</i>, because it is disagreeable to
our Prejudices, and because their allegorical
Expositions of some Miracles, if
they should receive such a Sense, will
bring Shame and Reproach to our Ministry.
Neither is the Authority of the
Fathers for Toleration, and against Persecution,
good; because it is destructive
of Ecclesiastical Power. Nor is the copious
Authority of the Fathers against
Preaching for Hire, good; because it
is averse to our Interests. Where the
Authority of the Fathers is agreeable to
our Interests, Power, and Prejudices,
there will we be for the Authority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25_Book8" id="Page_25_Book8">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the Fathers: But where the Fathers
are against us, there will we be against
them; and why should we not?" This
is the true Sense of the <i>Bishop</i>, tho' he
is so unhappy as to want the Talent clearly
and plainly to express his Mind.</p>

<p>But, like many others, who can't write
Coherence, nor consistently with themselves;
so the <i>Bishop</i>, for all his saying
that the allegorical Interpretations of
Scripture by the Fathers are of little or
no Authority, yet almost, if not altogether,
contradicts himself, and grants as
much as I desire, saying<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> thus, "With
relation to any Expositions of Scripture
made by the Fathers in early Times,
they must be allow'd to have had <i>some</i>
Advantage in being near to the Fountain
itself." I ask for nothing more from
the Bishop. Why do I contend for the
Authority of the Fathers as Interpreters
and Expositors? Only because they lived
nearer to the Days of <i>Christ</i> and his Apostles,
whose Mind and Will consequently
they must needs know better, than we at
this Distance: And because (what the
<i>Bishop</i> elsewhere grants) those primitive
Ages, as well as the Apostolical one, were
in some measure inspired, upon the credible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26_Book8" id="Page_26_Book8">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Testimonies of <i>Origen</i>, <i>Iren&aelig;us</i>, and
<i>Eusebius</i>, whose Words I shall not stay
here to produce.</p>

<p>Hence then, in the Authority of the
Fathers, I should think, there is Foundation
enough to build allegorical Interpretations
on, and particularly to prove the
literal Stories of Christ's Miracles to be
Emblems of future and mysterious Operations;
but all this will not do to pacify
and stop the Mouths of my Gainsayers.
This Controversy is <i>pro Aris &amp; Focis</i>, for
the ALL of the Clergy that is dear to
them; and therefore they will shuffle and
trifle for and against any Argument, rather
than yield. Tho' the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s
above speaks favourably of <i>Expositions
made by the Fathers in early Times</i>, and
may grant that the Church, in her first
Ages was inspired, yet he will still wrangle
against allegorical Interpretations, especially
such as I have made on some Miracles;
as for Instance, "On <i>Jesus</i>'s driving
the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple;
"On his precipitating the Swine
with the Devils into the Sea; "On his
healing the Woman of an Issue of Blood;
and the Woman of a Spirit of Infirmity, <i>&amp;c.</i>
because the Interests and Reputations of
the <i>Clergy</i>, as <i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Letter</i>, are
touch'd to the quick by them. So true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27_Book8" id="Page_27_Book8">[Pg 27]</a></span>
is that Saying of the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i>,
which deserves to be repeated, That
"where there is an Unwillingness to part
with Prejudices and worldly Interests,
there must of Course be a <i>Desire</i> that the
Christian Religion (<i>which consists in the
Ministry of the Spirit</i>) should not be true;
and a <i>Willingness</i> to favour and embrace
any Argument that is brought against it,
and to cherish any Doubts and Scruples
that shall be rais'd concerning it.</p>

<p>What must I do here then, since no
Authority, no, not the most primitive,
will suffice in this Case? Why, I have
nothing left to do, but absolutely to demonstrate,
and make the Matter as plain
as a <i>Pike-Staff</i>, that the Miracles of <i>Jesus</i>
will certainly receive such a mysterious
Accomplishment, as the Fathers and I
have before-hand interpreted them in.
Upon such a Demonstration, if the Mouths
of my Adversaries are not stopt, yet the
Eyes of all impartial <i>Readers</i> will be open'd
to behold what a Heap of Impertinence
the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s and others, have
hitherto urg'd against me.</p>

<p>Now to demonstrate absolutely, that
the Stories of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles will receive
such a mysterious Accomplishment, as I,
by the Help of the Fathers, have understood
them in, I must do these <i>two</i> things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28_Book8" id="Page_28_Book8">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p><i>First</i>, show, that the Old Testament
is to be allegorically interpreted, and is
already in Part, and will be entirely fulfilled
by <i>Jesus</i>, the true <i>Messiah</i>, in an allegorical
Sense. And thence</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Infer by a natural, obvious,
and necessary Consequence, that, what we
vulgarly call the New Testament is to be
allegorically interpreted also, even in the
Manner as I have understood some Parts
of it.</p>

<p>The <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s allows, that
there is better Authority, tho' not sufficient,
for the Interpretation of the <i>Old
Testament</i> allegorically; but supposing it
was better than it is, yet there is no
Consequence that the <i>New</i> should be also
allegorically interpreted. Behold his Words,
for fear of a Charge of Misrepresentation<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>.
"But besides this ill-founded
Imitation of St. <i>Paul</i> (in allegorical Interpretations
of the <i>Old</i> Testament)
will his mystical Expositions of any Passages
of the Old Testament support their
Pretensions (meaning the Fathers and
mine) to interpret the <i>New</i> in a like
mystical manner? No, it will not.&mdash;&mdash;And
therefore (<i>after a little more Reasoning
against this Consequence, he concludes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29_Book8" id="Page_29_Book8">[Pg 29]</a></span>
that</i>) this Practice of <i>Origen</i> and
other Fathers, that were mystical Expositors
of the <i>New Testament</i>, was very
precarious, and without Authority."
From which Words of the <i>Bishop</i>, it is
plain, that his Opinion is, that whatever
Authority there may be for the allegorical
Interpretation of the <i>Old</i> Testament, there
is no Consequence to be thence drawn,
that the <i>New</i> is to be interpreted in a
like mystical manner. But in Answer to
the <i>Bishop</i>, and in Confutation of his wild
and inconsiderate Assertion, I chuse to
treat on the two foregoing Particulars;
and the</p>

<p><i>First</i> is to show, that the <i>Old</i> Testament
is to be allegorically interpreted, and is already
in Part, and will be entirely fulfilled
by <i>Jesus</i> in an allegorical Sense.</p>

<p>That the <i>Old</i> Testament is to be allegorically
interpreted, I have Authority,
even ancient Authority enough, if that
would be allow'd to be sufficient to prove
my Point. We have Apostolical Authority
and Example for it. The Passages in
the Epistles of St. <i>Paul</i> and <i>Barnabas</i> to
this Purpose are numerous, and so well
known, that I need not recite all, or any
of them. And from the Passages in
St. <i>Paul</i>, that might be here produced,
the Fathers asserted and concluded from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30_Book8" id="Page_30_Book8">[Pg 30]</a></span>
his Authority, that the whole <i>Old</i> Testament
was to be allegorized. This I believe
the <i>Bishop</i> will grant, and spare me
the Pains of Citations out of them. And
if the <i>Bishop</i>, and my other <i>Adversaries</i>,
were of the same Mind with the Fathers,
on St. <i>Paul</i>'s Expressions in relation to
allegorical Interpretations of the <i>Old</i> Testament,
my present Dispute with them
would be half over. And what is the
Reason that the <i>Bishop</i> and others will not
give into the Opinion of the Fathers on
the Apostolical Passages to this Purpose?
Because of their Prejudices to the <i>Letter</i>
of the <i>Old Testament</i>, otherwise they
would urge St. <i>Paul</i>'s Authority for the
<i>Spirit</i> of it, as much as the Fathers or I
can do. But being, I say, prepossess'd of
<i>literal</i> Interpretations, and not discerning
any Force and Truth in <i>spiritual</i> ones, they
will not allow the mystical Expositions of
Scripture by <i>Origen</i> and other Fathers,
tho' made in Imitation of St. <i>Paul</i>, to be
of good Authority. And therefore I must
demonstrate to Sense and Reason, or Primitive
and Apostolical Authority will stand
me in no stead.</p>

<p>Again, If Authority for allegorical Interpretations
of the <i>Old</i> Testament would
avail any thing, there is ancienter, and I
had like to have said <i>better</i>, Authority for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31_Book8" id="Page_31_Book8">[Pg 31]</a></span>
them, than <i>that</i> of the Fathers and Apostles,
<i>viz.</i> the Authority of the more ancient
<i>Jews</i>. The Bishop of <i>St. David</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
says, "The Christian Fathers (and why
did he not say the <i>Apostles</i> too?) derived
this allegorical Practice from the Jewish
Interpreters." He owns<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> "that
<i>Philo Jud&aelig;us</i> was a great mystical Writer
as his Works which are extant testify";
and<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> confesses that "there is Reason
to believe, that this mystical Way
of expounding Scripture was of greater
Antiquity than <i>Philo</i> himself, even
amongst the <i>Essens</i> and <i>Therapeuts</i>,
whom <i>Philo</i> writes of, and who had
amongst them several ancient Books of
their Predecessors or Founders, full of
allegorical Interpretations." Thus far
the <i>Bishop</i> says well and truly. And what
Observation should he, as a Lover of Antiquity,
have made hereupon? Should he
not have said, <i>Id verius, quod prius</i>; the
older any Doctrine was, the more likely
to be true, in as much as Truth precedes
Error?</p>

<p>But could not the Bishop have carry'd
his Story of the allegorical Interpretation
of the <i>Old Testament</i> much higher? Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32_Book8" id="Page_32_Book8">[Pg 32]</a></span>
he might, and have told us what I do him
now, that the LXX Interpreters were <i>Allegorists</i>,
as appears from the Translation
itself, and from the Opinion of the ancient
Jews and Fathers of the Church concerning
them. And what's more still, he
might, as a Christian, upon the Authority
of St. <i>Hilary</i><a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> have derived the allegorical
Art of Interpretation from <i>Moses</i>
himself, who received it from God; and
instructed the <i>Seventy Elders</i> in it, from
whom it continued thro' all Ages of the
Jewish and Christian Churches, without
Interruption, excepting that Opposition
which the later <i>Caraites</i> of the Jews, and
<i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Letter</i> among Christians,
have made to it. If this be true, as I
firmly believe it, then the allegorical Method
of Interpretation is of original and
divine Right. And it is reasonable to think
accordingly, that it is of <i>Mosaic</i> and <i>divine</i>
Extraction, or the Apostles <i>Paul</i> and <i>Barnabas</i>,
and the Fathers afterwards, had
never been permitted of God to countenance
a Practice, in Imitation of the <i>Jews</i>,
if it was of a base, or of any other than
<i>divine</i> Original. The Consequence is, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33_Book8" id="Page_33_Book8">[Pg 33]</a></span>
we at this Day ought to be allegorical
Interpreters of the <i>Old Testament</i>, or we
set ourselves against all Antiquity, and
oppose a Tradition that's like a Command,
derived from <i>Moses</i> and God himself.</p>

<p>And what can the <i>Bishop</i> of St. <i>David</i>'s
say to this Consequence? Why, he'll tell
us, tho' the allegorical Method of Interpretation
be as ancient as the <i>Therapeuts</i>
and some of their Predecessors, yet, whatever
the <i>Jews</i> and Fathers may say of
its Antiquity, it came not from God and
<i>Moses</i>, or he would subscribe to it; but
took its Rise, some Ages after the Giving
of the Law of <i>Moses</i>, tho' he knows not
how nor when. And I am willing the
<i>Bishop</i> should please himself with such an
Answer and Opinion, till I have absolutely
demonstrated the Certainty of the allegorical
Method, and thence made it manifest,
that it is of Mosaick and divine
Original.</p>

<p>As to that other Account<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> of the
Original of mystical Interpretation of Scripture,
or at least of the greater Progress
and Improvement of it, which the <i>Bishop</i>
out of <i>Porphyry</i> gives, by saying the Fathers
learned it of the gentile Philosophers, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34_Book8" id="Page_34_Book8">[Pg 34]</a></span>
is the most senseless and <i>unscholarlike</i> Opinion
that a Christian can hold, and I was
surprised to see it come from him. It is true
that St. <i>Clement</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>, <i>Origen</i>, and
others, were very conversant in the
Writings of the <i>Greek</i> Philosophers: And
wherefore were they so? Was it to learn
mystical Theology of them? No, but,
as St. <i>Jerom</i><a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> says, to confirm the
Doctrines of our Religion, and to confute
the <i>Gentiles</i> out of their own Books.
For it was asserted by the Fathers, and
confess'd by the <i>Gentile</i> Philosophers,
that the Mythology of the <i>Greeks</i>, the
hieroglyphical Learning of the <i>Egyptians</i>
and the Oneirocritism of the <i>Chald&aelig;ans</i>,
was all borrowed from the <i>Hebrews</i>, and
had their Rise from the mystical and allegorical
Interpretation of the Scriptures,
as shall be made manifest, if the <i>Bishop</i>
and I go on in this Controversy: And
<i>therefore</i> the Fathers studied the Writings
of the <i>Greeks</i>, and made the foresaid
Use of them in the Conversion of the
<i>Gentiles</i>; which the <i>Bishop</i> can't but
know, if he remembers at all, what he
has read in St. <i>Clement</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>,
and other Fathers. But this, by the by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35_Book8" id="Page_35_Book8">[Pg 35]</a></span>
with a Hint to the <i>Bishop</i> to consider,
whether he, who holds here with
<i>Porphyry</i>, or I who hold with the Fathers,
writes the most like an <i>Infidel</i>. So much
then to the Accounts, which the <i>Bishop</i>
of St. <i>David</i>'s has given, of the Origine
of the mystical Interpretation of Scripture.</p>

<p>The <i>Bishop</i> of <i>Litchfield</i>, who is to be
looked on as a Writer in this Controversy,
has a large <i>Chapter</i> against the allegorical
Way of Interpretation. I shall comprise
his Opinion in a few Words out
of him. He says,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> <i>he is not concerned
to vindicate the Antiquity, ascribed by</i>
Philo, <i>to the allegoric Way of writing, much
less the Abuse it was carry'd to in After-Ages;
no, nor to defend, at all, this Manner
of writing</i>. And as to St. <i>Paul</i>'s allegorizing
the Scriptures, he says,<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> <i>It
seems to be in compliance with the Demand
of the Jewish Christians, who were affected
with allegoric Interpretations, that St.</i> Paul
(<i>who appears to have been no Fool</i>) <i>above all
the other Apostles used that Way, which he
was brought into against his own good liking</i>.
And in another Place he says,<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> <i>The
Laws and Facts recorded by</i> Moses, <i>are
commonly interpreted to natural, moral, theological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36_Book8" id="Page_36_Book8">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and even anagogick Senses, which
no one supposed to have been ever in</i> Moses<i>'s
Thoughts, or to be other than the Exercise
of a subtle Wit, for the Instruction and
Entertainment of the Hearers</i>. Whether
this <i>Bishop</i> had his Wits about him,
when he said, <i>No one supposed the anagogick
Senses of the Law to have been ever
in</i> Moses<i>'s Thoughts</i>, I can't tell; but if
he had rubb'd up his Memory a little, he
might have consider'd, what he says in
another Place,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> that the Anagogical
was the accustomed Way of the whole
Nation of the <i>Jews</i> from <i>Moses</i>'s Time;
and he might have known what St. <i>Hilary</i>,
whom I cited before, says, that <i>Moses</i>
taught the Children of <i>Isr&aelig;l</i> the anagogical
and allegorical Way; and whatever
he may think, <i>Origen</i> says,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> that <i>Moses</i>
by the Acuteness of his Understanding,
penetrated into the mystical and anagogical
Meaning of his own Law. And
tho' this <i>Bishop</i> says above, that he is not
concern'd to vindicate the Antiquity of
the allegorick Way of writing; yet I am
oblig'd to vindicate its Antiquity and
Truth, or I can't write a good <i>Defence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37_Book8" id="Page_37_Book8">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Christianity</i>, which should now bring me
(to what I have undertaken) to make an
absolute Demonstration of the Certainty
of the allegorical Method of Interpretation,
and of <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship upon it.</p>

<p>But before I enter upon a close Proof
of this grand Undertaking, I must beg
leave to tell my Readers a Story, which
tho' it will for while defer my undertaken
Demonstration, yet it is properly introductory
to it. I had not long drawn up
my foregoing Thoughts, (against the two
Bishops, of <i>Litchfield</i> and St. <i>David</i>'s) of
the Jewish and Christian Antiquity of the
allegorical Method of Interpretation of
Scripture, before I imparted them to my
old Friend the <i>Jewish Rabbi</i>, who is a
Cabalist and Allegorist, and desired his
Sentiments upon them. Whereupon he
was so kind as to send me the following
Letter, with a pertinent Objection in it,
against the Messiahship of the <i>Jesus</i> of
our <i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Letter</i>; with a pertinent,
I say, and lucky Objection, which
paves the Way for my Demonstration of
the Certainty of the allegorical Way of
Interpretation, and of the Messiahship of
the <i>Jesus</i> of us <i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>; and
if I can but prevail upon the two forenamed
<i>Bishops</i>, to give me their Assistance in answering
the said Objection, by humouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38_Book8" id="Page_38_Book8">[Pg 38]</a></span>
my Rabbi in it; we shall go a better Step,
than has been hitherto taken, for the Conversion
of the <i>Jews</i>: And this is Encouragement
enough to such hearty Friends
to Christianity as we are, to set about
so great and glorious a Work. The Letter
is as follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>SIR,</p>

<p>After condoling with you for the
extraordinary Penalty that was laid
on you for my Invective against <i>Jesus</i>'s
Miracle of <i>turning Water into Wine</i>, which,
in my Opinion, you should not have been
so heavily charg'd with, because it was
purely <i>Cabalistical</i>, and contains in it nothing
better or worse than the Conceptions
that we <i>Jews</i> entertain of <i>Jesus</i> and
his Miracles; I here send you my Thoughts
on the short Account you have given of
the Antiquity of the allegorical Method
of the Interpretation of Scripture.</p>

<p>You and the Fathers of your Church
are certainly in the right on't, to make
it as old as <i>Moses</i>, agreeably to the Opinion,
that we cabalistical <i>Jews</i><a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> at
this Day entertain of it. If it was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39_Book8" id="Page_39_Book8">[Pg 39]</a></span>
later Date and original, your Adversaries
are oblig'd to assign the Time <i>when</i>, and
the Occasion <i>how</i>, such a surprising and
extraordinary Method of Interpretation
was introduced into the Jewish Nation.
If our Ancestors in the Days of God's
inspired Prophet, <i>Moses</i>, heard of none
but literal Senses of the Law, and if
neither he nor God himself ever intended
they should run into the allegorical Strain,
I ask when and what was <i>that Incident</i>
which turn'd the Heads of our ancient
Nation so religiously and devoutly to it?
I can easily conceive how it came to pass,
that the Sect of the <i>Caraites</i> amongst us
<i>Jews</i>, who now adhere to the Letter,
deserted mystical Interpretations; and
why your <i>Ministers</i> of the <i>Letter</i> have
forsaken them; and that was because they
don't relish nor apprehend those divine
Mysteries, which <i>your</i> and <i>our</i> ancient
Allegorists so much talk'd of, as veil'd and
latent under the Law of <i>Moses</i>. But if
this be a good Reason, why they have
forsaken the allegorical Method, it is a
much better Reason, why our Ancestors,
of themselves should never have taken
it up. And therefore it is plain to me,
that God and <i>Moses</i> upon the Institution
of the Law, at the same Time imparted
the allegorical Method; or it could never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40_Book8" id="Page_40_Book8">[Pg 40]</a></span>
afterwards, <i>by chance</i>, have enter'd into the
Heads of Men, who have hitherto discern'd
so little Use and Fruits of it.</p>

<p>The Reason why God by <i>Moses</i> communicated
to the <i>Israelites</i>, and by his
Providence since has kept up the allegorical
Way of Interpretation of the Scriptures,
was to prepare the World for the
Reception of the <i>Messiah</i>, who was to be
the Accomplisher of them in an allegorical
Sense; and our Ancestors accordingly
so much excercised their Thoughts in
divine and mystical Contemplations on
the Law; because, they fancied, they
could thereby, as through <i>a Glass darkly</i>,
attain to some glimmering Foresight of
the Kingdom of the <i>Messiah</i>: For you must
know, that our old Cabalists<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> held
(what your <i>Jesus</i> undertook to fulfil)
that all Things that were written in the
Law and the Prophets, were, <i>to a Tittle</i>,
Type and Prophecy of the <i>Messiah</i>, who
would be so far the clear Fulfiller and
Illustrater of them, as that Men would
then see God <i>Face to Face</i>: And, to be
particular, they expected, in the first Place,
that the <i>Messiah</i> would work the Redemption
of his Church after the same manner,
and by the like Signs and Wonders that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41_Book8" id="Page_41_Book8">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<i>Moses</i> wrought the Deliverance of the
<i>Israelites</i> out of <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

<p>Agreeable to these our old Opinions
of the Scripture, and to our Expectations
of a <i>Messiah</i>, did the Fathers of your
Church endeavour to prove <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship,
by an allegorical Explication and
Application of the Law and the Prophets
to him: But in as much as they labour'd
in vain, proving little or nothing, this
Way, to the Satisfaction of our old <i>Jews</i>;
and in as much as your Priesthood have
altogether given over this Way of Proof;
we persist in our Disbelief of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Messiahship, and expect another for the
foresaid grand Purposes. Give me Leave
here to make an Objection, founded on
the concurrent and consentient Opinions
of <i>your</i> Fathers and <i>our</i> Ancestors, against
the Messiahship of <i>Jesus</i>, which if your
Priests can answer, agreeably to their
united Opinions, they will not only make
a Convert of me, but open a Door for
the Conversion of our whole Nation.</p>

<p>"It is agreed between us Jews, and
you Christians (excepting two or three
modern Commentators) that the Words
of <i>Deuteronomy</i>, xviii. 18. <i>I will raise
them up a Prophet from among their Brethren
like unto thee</i>, are a Prophecy of the
Messiah. From which Prophecy our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42_Book8" id="Page_42_Book8">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Ancestors<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> look'd upon <i>Moses</i> as a
Type of the Messiah, <i>in all Things</i>, and
expected that the <i>Messiah</i> at his coming
would by way of Antitype, imitate and
resemble <i>Moses</i> in all the History of his
Life, just as Face answereth to Face in
a Glass, or as a Substance agrees to its
Shadow. And I am well assured that
the Fathers of your Church accordingly
held and believed, what they endeavoured
to prove, that there was an exact
Similitude between <i>Jesus</i> in the
Christian Church, and <i>Moses</i> in the
Jewish. Now if your Priesthood can
perfect that Proof, and show me, either
in a literal or allegorical Sense, an exact
Resemblance, Correspondence, and
Likeness between them, I must of Necessity
turn Christian. It may be perhaps
a Work of too large an Extent for
them to shew this Agreement between
<i>Jesus</i> and <i>Moses</i> in all and every Particular;
I will be content therefore, if they
can shew me a Similitude between them
in a small Part of <i>Moses</i>'s Life; as for
Instance, in the History of <i>Moses</i>'s delivering
the <i>Israelites</i> out of <i>Egypt</i>. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43_Book8" id="Page_43_Book8">[Pg 43]</a></span>
was most expressly the Opinion of our
Ancestors, that the Messiah would deliver
his People from Bondage, and, if
I forget not, from <i>Roman</i> Bondage, after
the Manner, and by the like Wonders,
that <i>Moses</i> delivered his People from
<i>Egyptian</i>. <i>Jerom</i>,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> a Father of your
Church has recorded <i>this</i> as the universal
Opinion of our Ancestors, and
therefore you have the less Reason
to question it. And agreeably to
this Opinion of our Ancestors, the Fathers
of your Church asserted, that <i>Christ</i>
was such a <i>Messiah</i>, and did deliver
his Church from <i>Roman</i> Servitude,
after the same Manner (in a Figure)
that <i>Moses</i> delivered his <i>Israelites</i> out of
<i>Egypt</i>. Nay, your Apostle <i>Paul</i><a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
seems to assert it, saying, <i>Brethren, I
would not, that ye should be ignorant,
how that all our Fathers were under the
Cloud, and all passed through the Sea,
and were all baptized unto Moses in the
Cloud and in the Sea. Now these things
were our Examples or Types.</i> In which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44_Book8" id="Page_44_Book8">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Words <i>Paul</i> apparently alludes to, and
confirms the Opinion of our Ancestors,
which he had imbibed before his Conversion;
and intimates that <i>Jesus</i>, whom
he took for the <i>Messiah</i>, was working a
Redemption of his Church after the
Manner of the Deliverance of the <i>Israelites</i>
out of <i>Egypt</i>. And so did your
Fathers understand these Words of
<i>Paul</i>, and accordingly many of them
labour'd to shew the Similitude between
the <i>Israelitish</i> and <i>Christian</i> Redemption,
in order to the Conversion of the <i>Jews</i>.
But they, it seems, labour'd in vain,
shewing no tolerable nor visible Likeness
of this sort between <i>Jesus</i> and
<i>Moses</i>; and therefore our Nation to this
Day continues in Disbelief of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Messiahship. However, we have not
so pertinaciously rejected <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship,
as not to give you Leave to
resume the old Argument of it, from
his Likeness to <i>Moses</i> in all things. If
your <i>Priests</i> can now show a Likeness
between them; if they can at this Day
prove that <i>Jesus</i> wrought the like Miracles
and Wonders (tho' in a figurative
and allegorical Sense) for the Redemption
of his Church from <i>Roman</i>
Servitude, as <i>Moses</i> did for the Deliverance
of <i>Israelites</i> out of <i>Egypt</i>, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45_Book8" id="Page_45_Book8">[Pg 45]</a></span>
will grant him to be the <i>Messiah</i>, and
will believe in him. But as we despair
of such a Proof, so we reasonably persist
in our Disbelief of his Messiahship.
Your <i>Divines</i> indeed, because of the
foresaid Prophecy in <i>Deuteronomy</i>, do
talk of a Likeness between <i>Moses</i> and
<i>Jesus</i>; but it is not at all agreeable to
the Sentiments of <i>your</i> Fathers, or the
Expectations of <i>our</i> Ancestors concerning
the <i>Messiah</i>'s Similitude to <i>Moses</i>.
They tell us, that <i>Jesus</i> and <i>Moses</i> were
alike, because both wrought Miracles;
but this will not do, till they prove a
Likeness between their Miracles, as to
Number, Nature, Use and Circumstance.
The Miracles that the <i>Messiah</i>
is to work, and which are to prove his
Messiahship, must be of a similar Nature,
and to the like Purpose that <i>Moses</i>'s
were in <i>Egypt</i>, as <i>our</i> Ancestors asserted,
and <i>your</i> Fathers granted: But since
no such Similitude is shown to be between
them, we disown <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship,
and appeal to the Reason and
Understanding of all indifferent Judges
in the Controversy, whether we are not
in the right on't for so doing."</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, for the Use of your <i>Clergy</i>,
have I form'd an Objection against <i>Jesus</i>'s
Messiahship, an Objection that is founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46_Book8" id="Page_46_Book8">[Pg 46]</a></span>
on the concurrent Opinions of <i>our</i> Ancestors
and of <i>your</i> Fathers: And I shall
with some Longings and Impatience wait
till I hear what they have to say to it.
The Objection, in my Opinion, absolutely
destroys <i>Jesus</i>'s Pretences to the
Messiahship, unless his <i>Priests</i>, by way
of Answer to it, can prove the foresaid
Similitude between him and <i>Moses</i>; between
the Miracles of the One and the
Miracles of the Other; between the Deliverance
of the <i>Jewish</i> and the Redemption
of the <i>Christian</i> Church, out of an
<i>Egypt</i>.</p>

<p>I am thinking what your <i>Clergy</i> can
say to the Objection. Will they deny,
that it was the Opinion of both <i>your</i> Fathers
and of <i>our</i> Ancestors, that there
ought to be such a Similitude between
the <i>Messiah</i> and <i>Moses</i>, as is before describ'd?
That they can't do, because of
the innumerable Testimonies to be produced
out of them to confirm it. Will
they then say, that it was a false and erroneous
Opinion, which both ancient Jews
and Fathers entertain'd concerning the
<i>Messiah</i>? This surely they will not do;
because of the Consequence, which charges
the Apostle <i>Paul</i> himself (in the above-cited
Place) and the primitive Christians,
with the grossest Error and Mistake concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47_Book8" id="Page_47_Book8">[Pg 47]</a></span>
<i>Jesus</i> and his Messiahship; and
yet I can't think they will ever give into
the joint Opinion aforesaid of both <i>Jews</i>
and Fathers; because of the Impossibility
of proving <i>Jesus</i> to be like <i>Moses in all
Things</i>, according to the literal Sense of
the Law, which they adhere to; and because
of the Improbability of doing it, in
an allegorical Sense, after the Way of their
Fathers, or, in all this Time surely, the
Matter must have been made out, to the
Satisfaction and Conversion of our Nation.</p>

<p>I long, I tell you, to hear what your
Christian <i>Priesthood</i> will say to the Objection,
which surely they will not let slip,
without their Remarks and Observations
upon it, any more than my Objections
against the literal Story of some of <i>Jesus</i>'s
Miracles. And this is your and my Comfort,
that if you publish this present Objection
against <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship, the
<i>Clergy</i> can't account it a ludicrous, profane,
and blasphemous one (as they did
my others) and so bring you again under
Prosecution for it: No, it is a plain,
serious, and reasonable Objection, founded
on ancient Jewish and Ecclesiastical
Authority; and a pertinent, solid, and
rational Answer is expected to it.</p>

<p>Now the Controversy about <i>Jesus</i>'s
Messiahship is thus far revived and commenced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48_Book8" id="Page_48_Book8">[Pg 48]</a></span>
let us, in God's Name, go on
with it, till we come to a final Determination,
either in the Demonstration, or
Confutation of it. Your <i>Clergy</i>, can't, I
think, for Shame, any more interrupt the
free Course of the Controversy, which
will make us Jews secretly insult and triumph
over them; and not only confirm
us in our Unbelief of <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship,
but will occasion others to desert their
Faith in him.</p>

<p>It's a strange thing to consider how
your Priesthood have, in these latter Ages,
managed the Controversy between Jews
and Christians, all by themselves, furiously
disputing against Adversaries, whom they
will not allow with Impunity to speak in
their own Cause: So do they make God,
who is to decide the Controversy, like
an unjust and partial Judge, that will hear
only the Pleadings and Evidence on one
Side of the Question.</p>

<p>But your <i>Clergy</i> will say, that in their
Writings against the Jews, they make
Objections for us as well as Answers for
themselves, and that's sufficient. Not
so, say I, unless their Objections were as
good and strong as we can make for our
selves. But however, if your <i>Divines</i> so
please, I will thus agree the Matter with
them, <i>viz.</i> That they alone shall make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49_Book8" id="Page_49_Book8">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Objections for us, if they'll let us alone
to make Answers for them, which is most
just and equal; and then the World shall
behold the most pleasant and comical <i>Farce</i>
of a Controversy, they ever were entertain'd
with.</p>

<p>I remember, that in my Letter, you
published, against <i>Jesus</i>'s Resurrection,
I promised the Controversy between the
<i>Jews</i> and <i>Christians</i>, by my Consent,
should turn on that Miracle. Your <i>Clergy</i>,
one or other of them, have answer'd that
<i>Letter</i>; and so might expect to hear of
my Conversion, if I had nothing to reply
to them. My Reply you durst not publish,
for fear of worldly Tribulation, and
so I am free from that Promise. But now
that you have fortunately given me an
Occasion to make the more proper and
substantial Objection against <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship,
herein contain'd, I hope it will
be freely and fully debated and consider'd
to the Determination of the Controversy
between us. So wishing you Health and
Happiness, I am <i>Yours</i>,</p>

<p class="signature">
<i>N. N.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>So ends the Letter of my good old
Friend, the Jewish <i>Rabbi</i>, which was a
most seasonable and acceptable Present,
in as much as the Objection, contain'd in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50_Book8" id="Page_50_Book8">[Pg 50]</a></span>
it, will open a fair Way for me to prove,
that the Stories of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, as recorded
in the Evangelists, are and ought
to be allegorically understood, and will
certainly receive such a mystical Accomplishment,
as I, by the Help of the Fathers,
have conceived of them. The
<i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s, and my other Adversaries,
may not, in all Probability, be
aware of this Use to be made of the foresaid
Objection; and I don't expect that
on a sudden they should; but if they'll
favour me with, what otherwise I'll endeavour
to force them to, their Opinion
and Debates about the foresaid Objection
against <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship, they shall soon
discern this Use and Consequence of it,
that <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles are not <i>literally</i> but
<i>allegorically</i> to be understood, and will accordingly
receive an Accomplishment.</p>

<p>I trust then, that the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s,
who is principally concern'd, will,
without more Importunity, favour me
with his Opinion on the foregoing <i>Jewish</i>
Objection, which may be done in a small
Compass of Paper, either in <i>Print</i>, or in
an <i>Epistle</i>.</p>

<p>I expect he should tell me plainly and
expressly, whether it was really the joint
Opinion of the ancient <i>Jews</i> and Fathers
of the Church, as is affected in the Objection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51_Book8" id="Page_51_Book8">[Pg 51]</a></span>
that the <i>Messiah</i> was to be a Prophet
like <i>Moses</i> in all things, in the whole
History of his Life, and particularly with
regard to the miraculous Deliverance of
the <i>Israelites</i> out of <i>Egypt</i>. If the <i>Bishop</i>
should, what I humbly conceive he will
not, deny that it was the joint Opinion
of both <i>Jews</i> and Fathers, as is before
represented in the Objection, and should
pretend to urge Reasons and Authorities,
which he will hardly find, why such a
Likeness and Agreement between the
<i>Messiah</i> and <i>Moses</i> ought not to be look'd
for; then my <i>Rabbi</i> and I will confirm
the joint Opinion aforesaid, with Citations,
almost innumerable out of the <i>Jews</i>
and Fathers, till the <i>Bishop</i> shall yield to
the Number and Clearness of them.</p>

<p>If the <i>Bishop</i> should own, what I am
almost persuaded he will, that it was the
joint Opinion of Fathers and <i>Jews</i>, that
there ought to be such a Similitude and
Harmony between the <i>Messiah</i> and <i>Moses</i>,
as is represented above; but should say,
that it was an erroneous and false Opinion,
which the old Cabalistical <i>Jews</i>, by
chance, and unfortunately took up; and
which the Fathers, even the Apostle himself,
unwarily and unhappily run into,
complying with an Opinion of the <i>Jews</i>
about the <i>Messiah</i>, without Consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52_Book8" id="Page_52_Book8">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of the Weakness of it; then I, with a
little of my <i>Rabbi</i>'s Help, will further
prove the Truth and Certainty of the
said Opinion, and demonstrate, that He
can be no true Messiah, who in the History
of himself and of his Church does
not exactly, <i>to a tittle</i>, correspond to the
History of <i>Moses</i> and of his People.</p>

<p>But if the <i>Bishop</i> should, what I am
willing to hope he will, ingenuously confess,
there ought to be such an Agreement
and Likeness between <i>Moses</i> and the
<i>Messiah</i> as is signified in the Objection,
then he and I will go heartily to Work,
and for the Honour of <i>Jesus</i>, whom we
believe to be the <i>Messiah</i>, will absolutely
demonstrate the Similitude, there is between
him and <i>Moses in all Things</i>.
And this, by the by, in the Opinion of
our Fathers, is the <i>ONLY</i> Way to
prove <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship, <i>viz.</i> by his
Resemblance to <i>Moses</i>, and by his Accomplishment
of the Mosaick Types and
Prophecy concerning him, who, upon his
own Word, came to fulfil the Law and
the Prophets <i>to a Tittle</i>.</p>

<p>If the <i>Bishop</i> and I should be so fortunate,
and I trust in God we shall, as to
prove a most apparent and manifest Likeness
between <i>Jesus</i> and <i>Moses</i>, even such
a Likeness as my <i>Rabbi</i> above demands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53_Book8" id="Page_53_Book8">[Pg 53]</a></span>
then shall we stop his Mouth, and soon
pave a certain Way (which will be vast
Honour to the <i>Bishop</i>) for the Conversion
of the <i>Jews</i>.</p>

<p>I don't despair of the <i>Bishop</i>'s joint Labours
and Endeavours with mine to so
great and good a Work (for I can't think
in my Heart, that he'll otherwise wrangle
about the Objection above) so (if the
<i>Bishop</i> pleases) we'll begin this Work
with a Demonstration of the Likeness
there is between the Redemption of the
<i>Christian</i> Church, and the Deliverance of
the <i>Israelitish</i> out of <i>Egypt</i>. Not only
St. <i>Augustin</i><a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> hints that they who
would show a Likeness between <i>Jesus</i>
and <i>Moses</i> ought to begin here; but thereby
we shall humour my <i>Rabbi</i> in his Objection,
who calls for (upon the concurrent
Testimonies of <i>Jews</i> and Fathers)
a Proof of such a Likeness between the
Redemptions of the two Churches, or
he shall think it reasonable still to persist
in his Disbelief of <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship.</p>

<p>And if the <i>Bishop</i> and I should be so
happy as to shew in an apparent Manner,
this Similitude between the Redemption
of the Jewish and Christian Church out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54_Book8" id="Page_54_Book8">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of <i>Egypt</i>, then meeting with Success in
our Studies, will we proceed further, and
illustrate other Prophecies of succeeding
Times of the Church; for I will not part
with the <i>Bishop</i>, till he is able to travel
by himself, in his Contemplations on the
Law and the Prophets, and to behold,
what with an ordinary <i>Telescope</i> at the
Eyes of his Understanding he may discern,
and show to his Episcopal Brethren, <i>Christ</i>
spiritually sitting and coming on the
Clouds of the <i>Letter</i> to the same Purposes
that the old Jews, Fathers and Apostles
say he is to come, <i>viz.</i> To open and
illustrate the Parables and Ænigma's of
the Scriptures, to restore Prophecy, to
shew us God Face to Face; and to raise
All from a spiritual Death to Life again.
And blessed are all those, who love and
desire such his Appearance.</p>

<p>In my <i>Third Discourse</i> on <i>Miracles</i>, I
happen'd to speak of <i>Christ</i>'s second and
spiritual Advent on the Clouds of the Law
and Prophets; and to say "that the
common Notion of his Coming on &aelig;rial
Clouds for the Resurrection of dead
Bodies, <i>&amp;c.</i> is the most senseless and
unphilosophical, that ever was taught
to Mankind;" which gave Offence to
my <i>Bishop</i>, who animadverted upon me
for it; but if he ever get Sight, which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55_Book8" id="Page_55_Book8">[Pg 55]</a></span>
don't question, of <i>Christ</i>'s Coming on the
metaphorical Clouds of Prophecy, he'll not
only be of my Mind here, but will be sensible
with me, that all or most of our systematical
Divinity, that is built on the
<i>Letter</i> of the Scriptures, is false and
groundless; and of that ill Tendency to
the Corruption of Mens Morals, that it is
not so much a Wonder, that wise, good,
and thinking <i>Gentlemen</i> are betaking themselves
to Natural Religion, as it is, that
there are any Believers of Christianity, upon
the <i>Literal Scheme</i>, left among us. If
it had not been <i>Force</i>, more than <i>Reason</i>,
that has hitherto kept Mankind in their
Christian Faith; or if Liberty had been
indulg'd them to consider the Absurdities
of the <i>Letter</i> of the Scriptures, they would
have run ere now, by Shoals, into Infidelity:
But the allegorical Interpretation
(which the Cabalistical <i>Jews</i><a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> say, will
convert <i>Atheists</i>) will reduce Mankind to
the Belief of the inspired Authority of the
Scriptures, by shewing them the perfect
<i>Reason</i>, the divine <i>Wisdom</i>, and resplendent
<i>Truth</i> of them; otherwise call'd the
Messiah, the χρισμα, the Spirit, or the
<i>Christ</i> of them, than <i>whom</i>, or than <i>which</i>
nothing can be more desired by Philosophers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56_Book8" id="Page_56_Book8">[Pg 56]</a></span>
to come for the spiritual Renovation,
Restoration, Resurrection and Illumination
of Man; <i>consequently</i> and implicitly
for the Work of those mystical Miracles,
of which those wrought by <i>Christ</i>
in the Flesh are but Types and Figures.
Whether the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s be already
apprised of this Consequence, I
can't tell; but if he rub his Intellects but
a little, he must needs apprehend the
Consequence of the foresaid spiritual Advent
of <i>Christ thus</i> far "That Ministers
of the Letter then are certainly to be
turn'd out of the Church: "That the
Woman of the Church then will be cured
of her Infirmity at the Spirit of Prophesy:
"That the Eyes of Mankind, like
the blind Man's, will be then open'd to
see, what he has hitherto been dark about,
the Mystery of the Providence of God in
all Ages. And so of the mystical Accomplishment
of the other Miracles, with a
little Application of Thought, may he
discern the Consequence. And when he
does so, then he will see too, what sort
of a Christian I am, whom our <i>Ecclesiasticks</i>
have falsely accused, and unjustly
persecuted for Impiety, Profaneness, Blasphemy
and Infidelity, only because I have
written against the <i>Letter</i> of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles,
in order to turn Mens Heads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57_Book8" id="Page_57_Book8">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the Consideration of their mystical Accomplishment
at <i>Christ</i>'s second spiritual and
glorious Advent on the Clouds of the Law
and the Prophets.</p>

<p>I have indeed written against the <i>literal</i>
Stories of <i>Jesus</i>'s Miracles, which I still
nauseate and abominate the Confinement
of Mens Thoughts to it; but if our <i>Clergy</i>
would but a little bear with me, they
shall see, I <i>alone</i> do Honour to their literal
Stories, by making them beautiful Emblems
of future and more wonderful Operations.
I have indeed call'd <i>Jesus</i> an Impostor,
Juggler, Fortune teller (and what
not?) by way of Objection against the
<i>Letter</i> of his Miracles; but I <i>alone</i> shall
do him Honour, in those very Miracles,
which he wrought in the Flesh, by proving
him to be the Wisdom, as well as
Power of God, and that <i>God was in him
of a Truth</i>, and endued him with a divine
Prescience of Futurities, or he could not
then have wrought such curious and admirable
Models and Prefigurations of his
mysterious Works at his <i>second</i> Advent.</p>

<p>Whether the <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s, and
others, can as yet certainly discern the
foresaid Consequence of Christ's mystical
Accomplishment of his Miracles upon his
spiritual Advent, I can't guess; but if
they'll favour me with their Opinion on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58_Book8" id="Page_58_Book8">[Pg 58]</a></span>
my <i>Rabbi</i>'s Objection above, which will
lead us to the allegorical Interpretation of
the Law, they shall soon clearly see it.</p>

<p>And now I would have the <i>Bishop</i> of
<i>St. David</i>'s to compare <i>this Part</i> of my
<i>Defence</i> with the <i>Third Chapter</i> of his <i>Vindication</i>,
which treats <i>on the Practice of
the Fathers in interpreting the Scriptures in
a mystical and allegorical Method</i>, and consider
whether He or I write the most like
a Christian of an orthodox and primitive
Faith and Practice. The <i>Bishop</i> says<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
"That it is certain, that without such
Assistance (<i>of the Spirit</i>) as St. <i>Paul</i> enjoy'd,
the mystical Expositions of the
Scripture by <i>Origen</i> and other Fathers,
tho' made in Imitation of St. <i>Paul</i>, have
no such Authority as that of St. <i>Paul</i>
stampt on them." What, in the Name
of Wonder, does the <i>Bishop</i> here mean?
Tho' St. <i>Paul</i> has not allegoriz'd the whole
Law, but only some few Parts; yet he
expressly says, often enough, that the
whole is a <i>Figure</i> and <i>Shadow</i> of Things
to come under <i>Christ</i>; and our Saviour
himself, as the Fathers understood him,
intimates often, that all Things that were
written in the Law and the Prophets, are
Types and Prophecy of him, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59_Book8" id="Page_59_Book8">[Pg 59]</a></span>
came to fulfil them <i>to a Tittle</i>. Is not
here Authority enough for the Fathers to
allegorize the whole Law and the Prophets,
in order to shew the Agreement
between the Type and Antitype; between
the Shadow and the Substance; between
the Figure and the Thing figured; and
between the Prophecy and its Accomplishment.
And whether the Fathers, in their
allegorical Expositions, rightly or not, hit
off the Sense of the Prophecy; (for it must
be confess'd they variously allegorized <i>this</i>
and <i>that</i> Passage of Scripture) yet it was
<i>their</i> and <i>our</i> Duty and Office, from the
Words of <i>Christ</i>, and the Practice of the
Apostle, to keep on in the allegorical Method,
till an Harmony between the Prophecy
and its Accomplishment was made
most clear.</p>

<p>The <i>Bishop</i> says in this his <i>Third Chapter</i>
of his <i>Vindication</i>, "That the Fathers
and I have abusively cited this Passage
of St. <i>Paul</i>, <i>The Letter killeth, but the
Spirit giveth Life</i>, in Justification of our
mystical Expositions;" whereupon the
<i>Bishop</i> gave us a large Explication out of
his own Head, on that whole Verse; which
(because of the Shallowness of my own
Pate, or the Confusion of the Bishop's)
I don't understand, and much question,
whether the <i>Bishop</i> understands himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60_Book8" id="Page_60_Book8">[Pg 60]</a></span>
However, I will here paraphrastically give
my <i>Readers</i> the easy, plain, and intelligible
Sense of the Fathers and my self on
that whole Verse<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> thus, <i>Who hath made
us able Ministers of the New Testament, not
of the Letter</i> [that is, not of the literal Sense
of the Law and the Prophets, which is
the <i>Old</i> Testament] <i>but of the Spirit</i>,
[that is, of the spiritual Sense of the Law
and the Prophets, which is the <i>New</i> Testament]
<i>for</i> [as the Testimony of <i>Jesus</i>,
according to St. <i>John</i>, is the Spirit of Prophecy,
so] <i>the Letter</i> [that is, the literal
Sense of the Law and Prophets] <i>killeth</i>
[that is, nulls the Testimony of <i>Jesus</i>
which is in them] <i>but the Spirit</i> [that is,
the spiritual Sense of the Law and Prophets]
<i>giveth Life</i> [to their prophetical
Testimony.] This is most certainly the
Sense of the Fathers on this Text; and I
believe the <i>Bishop</i> will not gainsay it, tho'
he may dislike it. Hence the Fathers,
when they spoke <i>properly</i> and not <i>vulgarly</i>,
call'd the spiritual Sense of the Law and
the Prophets, the<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> <i>New Testament</i>,
and asserted that there was or would be
such an Agreement between the <i>Old</i> and
<i>New</i> Testament; that is, between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61_Book8" id="Page_61_Book8">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Testament of the <i>Letter</i>, and the Testament
of the <i>Spirit</i> of the Scriptures, as
that there would not be<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> one Tittle
in the <i>one</i>, that would not be consonantly
fulfilled in the <i>other</i>; and so far as I already
apprehend this Harmony between
these two Testaments, of the <i>Letter</i>, and
of the <i>Spirit</i>, I must needs say with <i>Origen</i><a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
that it's <i>pleasant and ravishing to
behold and contemplate it</i>, and hope in a
short time to make the Bishop of St. <i>David</i>'s
a Partaker of the same Pleasure. The
same right Notion had the Fathers of the
<i>Gospel</i> of <i>Christ</i>, which they have of the
<i>New Testament</i>. <i>Vulgarly</i> speaking, the
Writings of the Evangelists, and of the
Apostles, were call'd the <i>Gospel</i> of <i>Christ</i>:
But properly speaking, Christ's <i>spiritual
Accomplishment</i> of the Law was the <i>Gospel</i>:
Hence is the Meaning of their frequent
saying, "That under the Law the Gospel
was vail'd, and under the Gospel the
Law was reveal'd." Hence they said,
"That those Men had nothing of the
<i>Gospel</i>, who understood not the Spirit of
the <i>Law</i>." Hence they said, "The Gospel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62_Book8" id="Page_62_Book8">[Pg 62]</a></span>
was hid to those, who had the Veil
of the <i>Letter</i> upon their Hearts in reading
of the Old Testament." Hence it
was too, that they said, "That the Gospel
was but <i>in Part</i>, and that too in a
very <i>little Part</i>, reveal'd at <i>Christ</i>'s first
Coming; the full Revelation of it being
reserv'd for his second and more glorious
Advent, which the World is now in great
Want of, for the curing of their spiritual
<i>Blindness</i>, <i>Deafness</i>, and <i>Lameness</i>; that
is, for the Correction of their gross Ignorance
and Errors in Religion; for the
Healing of their Divisions; for the Manifestation
of Truth; for the Conversion of
<i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i>; and for the Reformation
of the Manners of Mankind.</p>

<p>Dear <i>Jesu</i>, to what a sad Purpose have
our Hired Priesthood and <i>Ministers</i> of the
<i>Letter</i>, of all Denominations, hitherto
studied and preach'd, even till they have
lost the true, primitive, and Apostolical
Notion of "the <i>Gospel</i>; "of <i>Revelation</i>;
and "of the <i>New Testament</i>!</p>

<p>The Bishop of <i>London</i> has of late publish'd
two <i>Pastoral Letters</i> on the Certainty,
Necessity, and Use of Revelation,
against <i>Infidels</i>, particularly against my
self, whom he (God help his Understanding!)
takes for a Favourer of Infidelity:
And to do the <i>Man</i> Justice, I believe he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63_Book8" id="Page_63_Book8">[Pg 63]</a></span>
sincere, and laments at his Heart the Unbelief
of this Age: But however, when
the true <i>Gospel</i>, otherwise call'd the <i>Revelation</i>
of the Law and the Prophets, or
the <i>New Testament</i> (which will be fatal
to the Ministry of the Letter, and an
hired Priesthood) shall be republished, restored,
and repreach'd, I dare say, without
Censoriousness, or pretending to a
prophetick Spirit, that He, of all the Inhabitants
of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i>, will
be the greatest Enemy to it; and for no
other Reason than his own, "because of
his Unwillingness to part with his
worldly Interests, which will induce
him to embrace any Arguments against
it, and to cherish any Doubts and Scruples
concerning it."</p>

<p>Whether the Bishop of St. <i>David</i>'s intends
to proceed in this Controversy
against me, as he has begun, I know not.
He promised us his <i>Second Volume</i> last
Winter, but has adjourn'd the Publication
of it to the next, and I am apt to
think he'll defer it to <i>latter Lammas</i>: For
being, I suppose, sensible, that his <i>First
Volume</i> is built on the false Bottom of my
supposed Infidelity, he'll hardly trouble
the World with another of that kind.
But however, I'll not release him out of
the Controversy. I shall insist upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64_Book8" id="Page_64_Book8">[Pg 64]</a></span>
letting me know his Opinion on my <i>Rabbi</i>'s
Objection against <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship,
herein contain'd, which if he'll favour me
with, I'll forgive him all the Virulence,
and pass by all the Impertinence (to say
no worse) of his <i>Vindication</i>: Otherwise
I shall be tempted to do an unpleasant
Work to myself, as well as an ungrateful
one to him; that is, further to expostulate
with him for his false Accusations, Misrepresentations,
and other ill Usage of
me.</p>

<p>When I review my <i>Discourses</i> on <i>Miracles</i>,
and consider not only their visible
Tendency to the Proof of <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship,
but my solemn Declarations of
the Belief of Christianity; I wonder that
such a Number of Writers against me
should all of them (excepting Mr. <i>Laurence</i><a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
whom I here thank and praise
for his Ingenuity) take me for an Infidel.
I don't indeed much wonder, that the
inferior Tribe of <i>Levi</i> (such is their egregious
Ignorance!) should take me for one;
but that such presumed great <i>Scholars</i>, as
are the Bishops of <i>London</i> and St. <i>David</i>'s,
should so mistake me, is astonishing. And
I am not as yet fully satisfied, whether it
be their <i>Ignorance</i> or their <i>Malice</i>, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65_Book8" id="Page_65_Book8">[Pg 65]</a></span>
to accuse me of Infidelity: If it was really
<i>Ignorance</i> in them, they'll soon be convinced
of their Error; and then, like
good Christians, they'll make me Satisfaction
for the Injuries done me. But if it
was <i>Malice</i>, and in Revenge on me for
writing so much against an <i>Hired-Priesthood</i>,
then they'll go on, and <i>die hard</i>,
without any Remorse for the Troubles,
Sufferings and Expences they have put
me to.</p>

<p>As I am really a Christian, and shall,
by God's Help, demonstrate the Messiahship
of <i>Jesus</i>, to which my <i>Discourses</i> on
his <i>Miracles</i> were subservient; so I will
make bold to tell the <i>Bishops</i> concern'd,
that I am as certainly persecuted, as ever
any Christian was since the Days of the
Apostles: And they will do well to consider,
whether they have not everlastingly
disgraced themselves, and done some
Dishonour to the best Civil Administration,
that ever Nation was bless'd with, by
engaging them in the Persecution of the
most sincere Advocate for the Truth of
Christianity, that ever set Pen to Paper.</p>

<p>I am so far from being an Infidel, that,
notwithstanding my <i>Discourses</i> on <i>Miracles</i>,
I am an implicit Believer, and most
devout Admirer of Doctrines, Historical
Facts, and Traditions of the primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66_Book8" id="Page_66_Book8">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Church, adhering to many Notions of the
Fathers, besides their allegorical Scheme
(as will be seen in the Sequel of this
Controversy) which the <i>Divines</i> of these
last Ages have rejected, as so many Weaknesses
and Mistakes in them. And when
I come more fully to open my Mind, it
will be well if the <i>Clergy</i> don't change
their <i>Note</i> about me; and instead of accusing
me of Infidelity, ridicule me for
too much Credulity, and even Superstition;
or I would not espouse <i>such</i> and <i>such</i>
Doctrines and Traditions, which all learned
and Protestant <i>Criticks</i> have discarded.
Some of these old Notions I'll keep to
myself, for fear of being over-much laught
at by the <i>Clergy</i> for them, but others upon
Occasion I will divulge; and don't care
if I tell my <i>Readers</i> here one of them,
thus:</p>

<p>"The Fathers intimate that <i>Ministers</i>
of the <i>Letter</i> are Worshippers of the
Apocalyptical <i>Beast</i>, or <i>Anti-Christ</i>;
and that <i>that Beast</i> of a God, old <i>Baal</i>,
was a Type of <i>Anti Christ</i>." This their
Opinion I found hard to digest; but if
there be any Truth in it, it can't be unlawful
to jest a little with his Priests, or
to ridicule their nonsensical, foolish and
absurd Doctrines, founded on the <i>Letter</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67_Book8" id="Page_67_Book8">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>But let my Theological Notions and
Speculations be of what kind soever; what
Harm can my Arguings for them do to
the Community? None at all. If they
are not of God, they will come to nought
sooner and better than by a Persecution
of me for them. But if they are of God,
they will stand and prevail against all Opposition
of the <i>Clergy</i>, who will lose their
Reputation, if they take any other Measures,
than what Reason and Religion
do allow of, to suppress them.</p>

<p>My earnest Request then to the <i>Clergy</i>
is, that under the Debate I am like to
have with them, they would be pleased
to keep their Temper; or wise and impartial
By-standers will say, that it's more
for their Interests than the Truth, that
they are zealous and furious.</p>

<p>I am not afraid of another Prosecution
at Law, because I already have, or soon
shall cut off all Pretences to it, by clearing
myself of all Suspicions of Infidelity;
but, for all that, I am more apprehensive
of the Rage and Indignation of the <i>Clergy</i>,
than if I had been a downright <i>Atheist</i>.
No <i>Atheist</i> or <i>Deist</i> is or can be of
that dangerous Consequence to the modern
Priesthood, as the Christian Allegorist.
Against the Growth of Deism and
Atheism, the <i>Clergy</i> may be able for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68_Book8" id="Page_68_Book8">[Pg 68]</a></span>
time to maintain their Ground; but upon
the Revival of the <i>Ministry</i> of the <i>Spirit</i>
of the Law and the Prophets, they
can't stand long. And if I should demonstrate,
what I have undertaken, the Certainty
of the allegorical Scheme, and <i>Jesus</i>'s
Messiahship upon it; tho' <i>Jews</i> and
<i>Infidels</i> then will be ready to rejoice, yet
Ministers of the Letter, notwithstanding
their pretended Love to, and Faith in
<i>Jesus</i>, will be enraged; and it will be
well, if I don't feel the Weight of their
Displeasure and Resentment. If that foolish
old <i>Dotard</i>, Mr. <i>Ayscough</i><a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> the
<i>Rector</i> of St. <i>Olave</i>'s, <i>Southwark</i>, could
find in his Heart to instigate the Mob to
<i>drag me through the Streets, and throw me
into some Repository of Filth and Nastiness</i>,
what may I not dread from young hot-headed
<i>Priests</i>, upon the Performance of
what is here undertaken? But I hope our
pious and good <i>Bishops</i>, notwithstanding
the Danger of their <i>Thousands</i> a Year,
will be my Safeguard.</p>

<p>After all, it is a sad and melancholick
Consideration, that the Understandings of
Mankind, especially of the Wise, Thinking
and Philosophical Part of them, should
be enslaved to the Interests of Ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69_Book8" id="Page_69_Book8">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<i>Clodpates</i>, who for the sake of <i>Mammon</i>
more than <i>Truth</i>, are furious and turbulent;
otherwise any Opinions in Religion
might be profess'd, consistently with
the Peace of the Publick; and any Speculations
publish'd without Animosities and
Molestations.</p>

<p>What Course can be taken with the
<i>Clergy</i>, to persuade them to Patience and
Forbearance, whilst I prove them to be
the most stupid Sect of Philosophers, who
have amongst them the fewest Rudiments
of true Philosophy, and even of the Gospel,
of any Sect the World ever knew?
It's said, there is nothing so absurd, which
some of the old Philosophers have not held;
but there is nothing, for Absurdity, equal
to this Belief, that the <i>Bible</i>, for its literal
Story, is the Word of God, and given
by Inspiration of him.</p>

<p>The <i>Bishop</i> of <i>St. David</i>'s complains<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
of my unmannerly Behaviour towards
my Ecclesiastical Superiors; and I must
confess, I am no body at that low and
<i>Right Reverend</i> Bow, that he is fam'd for,
or I might have put in for a <i>Bishoprick</i>
before now: But if our <i>Bishops</i> and <i>Clergy</i>
will be pleased to keep their Temper, till
I get to the End of this Controversy, I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70_Book8" id="Page_70_Book8">[Pg 70]</a></span>
pass such Compliments upon them for their
good Humour and Learning too, if they
deserve it, as they hardly ever met with.</p>

<p>To conclude, I have written as plainly
and intelligibly as I can, in this <i>Part</i> of
my <i>Defence</i>. If any one shall complain
of Obscurity any where, I will, upon Intimation,
endeavour to illustrate it. I
have, in some Places, asserted Things upon
the Authority of the Fathers, without
producing their Testimonies, in Proof
of them; but if any question, whether
their Testimonies can be here or there
urg'd, they shall, upon a proper Occasion,
have Satisfaction given them. The Reason
why I have sometimes omitted the
Testimonies of the Fathers, where they
might be look'd for, is because I study
Brevity, intending never to publish at
once a larger <i>Volume</i> than this present.
And no body need question my Testimonies
to be ready at Hand; because I have
neither the Courage nor Confidence (like
many others) to vent any new Doctrines
out of my own Head. My Talent is only
to illustrate what the Fathers have asserted;
and tho' some would account me a
Falsifier and Misrepresenter of primitive
Authorities, my honest Endeavours shall
be to turn the Hearts of our <i>Clergy</i>, who
are like Children in Understanding, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71_Book8" id="Page_71_Book8">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Fathers. I shall end all <i>seriously</i>, <i>gravely</i>,
<i>calmly</i> and <i>sedately</i>, with the same Words
that I began my <i>First Discourse</i> on <i>Miracles</i>
with, saying, "If ever there was a
useful Controversy started or revived in
this Age of the Church, it is this about
the Messiahship of the Holy <i>Jesus</i>,
which the <i>Discourse of the Grounds</i>, &amp;c.
has of late rais'd. I believe this Controversy
will end in the absolute Demonstration
of <i>Jesus</i>'s Messiahship from
Prophecy, which is the only Way to
prove him to be the Messiah, that great
Prophet expected by the <i>Jews</i>, and promised
under the old Testament." And
whether Bishop <i>Smalbroke</i> or Mr. <i>Stackhouse</i>
will believe me, or not, I do now
solemnly declare, that what I have written
in my <i>Discourses</i>, or shall write in
these <i>Defences</i>, is with a View to, what
I am persuaded I shall effect, the absolute
Demonstration of the Messiahship of the
Holy <i>Jesus</i>, to whom be Glory for ever
and ever. <i>Amen.</i></p>

Quanquam sit Ordo Gestorum, &amp; sepeliri eum erat necesse,
qui resurrecturus erat a mortuis, tamen non sine Rerum
aliquarum Momento expressa sunt singula. Joseph Apostolorum

intelligitur sub lintei hujus nomine consepeliri Christo Ecclesiam:
